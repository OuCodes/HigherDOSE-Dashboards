Can you review @/exports and @/mail in the exports folder and categorize the markdown files into the following categories from the last 7 days starting yesterday and use this naming structure for the file "weekly-growth-report-highlights-" with todays date at the end. Also cite all resources used to find this information so its easier for the model to find context when I need to get more details about these highlights.

You are an expert marketing analytics editor. Combine the latest “highlights” and “with-products” performance exports into a single Weekly Growth Report, using the most recent previously combined report solely as a style/structure reference.

Inputs:
- Highlights (latest):
  @/Users/jourdansmith/code/research/HigherDOSE/data/reports/weekly/weekly-growth-report-highlights-2025-09-22.md
- Performance (latest):
  @/Users/jourdansmith/code/research/HigherDOSE/data/reports/weekly/weekly-growth-report-with-products-2025-09-23.md
- Style/structure reference (last combined):
  @/Users/jourdansmith/code/research/HigherDOSE/data/reports/weekly/weekly-growth-report-2025-09-15-combined.md

Goal:
Produce a new combined report for the 7-day period covered by the latest performance export (2025-09-16–2025-09-22), following the section order, tone, and formatting of the last combined file while updating all content with the latest data and highlights.

Strict requirements:
- Use the performance export as the single source of truth for all metrics, tables, and values. Do not invent or recalc numbers.
- Preserve all tables (channel breakdowns, product/category performance, top campaigns, channel metrics, YoY tables, and the “Top Unattributed Spend” appendix) exactly as in the performance export, adjusting only any headings to match the style reference.
- Integrate the highlights content into sections like “Wins & Updates,” “Challenges,” “Opportunities & Solutions,” “Daily Task List & Priorities,” “Motion & Creative Reporting Insights,” and “Website & CRO,” mirroring the style reference’s headings and tone.
- For the Executive Summary:
  - Include concise YoY and WoW callouts using the values from the performance export.
  - Keep the narrative style consistent with the style reference.
- Frontmatter:
  - Follow the style reference’s frontmatter keys and order.
  - Update dates/period to match the latest week (2025-09-16–2025-09-22).
  - Keep `recipient: "Ingrid"` and appropriate `report_type` as per the reference.
- Sources:
  - Update the “Sources” section to reference the two latest input files (highlights and performance).
  - If inline citations are present in highlights, retain them and ensure paths remain absolute.
- Language and formatting:
  - Match the tone, headings, and section ordering of the last combined report.
  - Keep bullet/numbered list formatting and bold emphasis conventions consistent with the style reference.
  - Do not include any editorial notes, TODOs, or meta commentary in the output.

Output:
- Return the complete, ready-to-save Markdown for the new combined report.
- Use a filename slug consistent with prior naming, e.g. “weekly-growth-report-2025-09-22-combined.md”.
- Ensure all dates, period ranges, and figures reflect the latest performance export.
