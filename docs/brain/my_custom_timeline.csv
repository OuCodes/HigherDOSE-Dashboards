2021-04-26T11:41:00,slack,Victoria,general,message,@User_8P5HJ4 are you familiar with OnTrac for west coast?
2021-04-26T11:42:00,slack,User_8P5HJ4,general,message,"OnTrac, Axlhire etc are west coast focused delivery companies. They are great services when you have a warehouse in the west coast. If they serve from Salt Lake City its even better but I would like to check if there are any up charges for pickup from SLC. In that case UPS , FEDEX ground can be cheaper and the transit times can be similar. "
2021-04-26T11:45:00,slack,User_8P5HJ4,general,message,I did a lot of work on the last mile delivery companies like these. There are a few in the east coast too. We should look into our customers/ orders distribution by state for last few months and discuss possible options. 
2021-04-26T11:48:00,slack,Chris Jacob,general,message,They're the same price so if there's no customer side concern we'll go ahead. RS will only use them when they need the space
2021-04-26T11:49:00,slack,Chris Jacob,general,message,Which is currently only an issue on mats on some days given their size
2021-04-26T11:49:00,slack,Chris Jacob,general,message,but the issue will increase once we get into the holidays if the carriers are similarly unprepared this year
2021-04-26T12:01:00,slack,User_8P5HJ4,general,message,Agreed. These last mile companies were great in the holidays. The one I used in the east coast was 98% success throughout the holidays and COVID. That was really really impressive

2021-04-27T09:52:00,slack,Chris Jacob,general,message,wait are they trying to get us to increase or decrease price
2021-04-27T09:52:00,slack,Victoria,general,message,increase - originally on the website we were charging 469 euros so that’s what they were charging
2021-04-27T09:53:00,slack,Victoria,general,message,they negotiated hard with us and if we keep 399 USD we probably will just have to part ways from then
2021-04-27T09:53:00,slack,Victoria,general,message,they are similar to goop in the UK

We have kept where it was before taking over, but would love to have the go ahead for another $350 in daily spend (we are currently around $825 daily). That would add $4200 to the tiktok monthly budget for april. Second, I know we spoke about making sure the copy matches the creatives yesterday. While using this current campaign type tiktok assigns the copy and given its performance we would like to avoid shutting it down.

Actions taken and points for next week
-
Our lower AOV product funnel went live today. We are starting with a
traffic campaign to build an audience over the next 3-5 days. We can use
this to learn the best audiences to target for the bottom of the funnel as
well as build a true long term retargeting list.
-
The body sculptor presale creatives are live in a traffic campaign as
well. The plan is to move these to conversion in July, however since we are
trying to drive awareness of a higher end product not fully available we
are starting with traffic.
As always, please let us know if you have any questions at all! We're
working to get more MBS creative live before the weekend as well. Excited
to report on this next week!
Thank you and have a great weekend!

Product Information & Decks

## Body

Hey Jess!
Wanted to connect you directly with Jourdan (our new Growth Strategist) so
you can share all things product with him. Will you send all the product
and education decks with him? I told him we will be mostly offline
next week due to our offsite so be good if he can review on his own as he
onboards and then when you're back in office you guys should sync for a
general chat.
I'll leave you both here to connect.

Hi Sharma Team,
I’m \*so\* excited to introduce you to \*Jourdan Smith\*, our new \*Growth
Strategist\*, who’s joining to support me (and all of us) on everything
performance media, product sales funnel optimization, LTV growth, and CAC

Jourdan brings deep experience across high-AOV and wellness brands, and I
know he’ll be an incredible partner in driving our next phase of growth and
profitability.
Please add him to all relevant Slack channels, docs, and invites. He’ll
join our smaller group meeting this Monday.
\*Ari/Berkley\* – it’d be great for you each to grab some 1:1 time with him
next week. I’ll let you two coordinate directly.
Welcome, Jourdan!

Hi Ingrid and Jourdan,
Amazing news and so happy to meet you, Jourdan! We'll get our docs packaged
up and excited to hit the ground running together. On the Slack side, @Ingrid
Milman Cordy  we're not able to add HD members to
our joint channels so would need your support there when you have a moment.
Looking forward to our Monday smaller group and Jourdan we'll reach out now
on email under separate cover to coordinate a 1:1 between Jake, Berkeley,
you, and me for next week. Can't wait.
Thank you so much,
Ari

Thanks for catching up yesterday! Wanted to make sure you had a clear list
of things to do this week while I'm traveling at this offsite. Let me know
if you have any questions.
1) Paid Media Audit: Year to Date (compared to previous) and Q2 to Date
- What channels are working hard for us that we need to continue investing
in?
- What channels have potential that we haven't fully unlocked yet?
- How can we start to efficiently ""fill the funnel"" in prep for Q4 with our
Q3 investments?
- Review our structure, efficiency measurement approach and suggest things
we Stop, Continue, and Test as we evolve
2) Get to know our products and how they work and analyze our ads creative
Jess sent over our product education decks - they are amazing resources for
helping you determine if our ads are doing a good enough job conveying
those benefits
3) Connect with Laura on creative content briefing - work on a timeline,
process and workflow together to make sure you guys are working together to
make it the process fast and efficient and meeting our frequent content
needs.
That should be plenty for the rest of the week - but let me know if you
have questions or get through this sooner. Also remember we are off for
Juneteeth on Thursday. I'll setup time for us to reconnect Monday after the
Sharma call.
Thanks!
Ingrid

| |  | | --- | | Hi TikTok Shop Seller! | | We want to streamline and simplify the order return process for both you and your customers! Now, customers can use the same return label and QR code for up to **30 days**. You can find the updates in our **[Customer Order Cancellation, Return, and Refund Policy](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ7cwKdXsSd4)****.** | | Previously, while customers had 30 days to return an item, return labels and QR codes expired after 14 days. This meant customers had to re-initiate a return request if they didn’t ship the item within the 14 day window. | | Now, return labels and QR codes will be valid for the full 30-day return period — removing the need to resubmit a request after 14 days. | | For more information, refer to our **[Guide to Managing Returns, Refunds and Replacements.](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ7cwKdY9Vf4)** | | Be sure to regularly check **[TikTok Shop Academy](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ7cwKdYQYh6)** to stay informed and follow the **[@TikTokShopAcademy](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ7cwKdYhbjd)** channel for tips and tricks on staying up to date. | |

This is why people love Motion…here’s how to create a report that shows you which of your ads are winning.

Hi Jourdan,
Welcome to Motion! 🎉 I'm Kyra, it's great to meet you!
Creative has become one of the biggest levers for growth in paid social. Motion is here to make sure you can keep a pulse on what's working and where to go next so you can keep shipping more winning ads. 🚀
Over the next few weeks, I'll be sharing our most impactful analyses + tips and tricks to help you easily find and share creative insights!
Ready to learn it all now? Dive into all our favorite analyses here. (https://content.motionapp.com/e3t/Ctc/GF+113/d2hYgB04/VWLqNn2mXtxrW1P8BFK2bdBckW6TYKFS5xWZvpN7-7xzY3prCCW95jsWP6lZ3pKW3MQQTv3LkqvXVFSDhg8YmCPbW4N1gvm1Wkx0rW20Fcp44QBDsLW8wfYSp3xt6w4W8YRvqL2lGMj8W61Wzpf7qGhF2W94Ns814pHbrLW4RJX7R1jQ\_s4W6M-Q9Q8qyW\_FW41NNz74LGs0pW8DvK1w5xXlY9W4XgBKr50w7kfN1rSv6-h2dyyW7RLYK06fKD8xW2XNMQB4D2zHyW36vNBj7fgt4CW1-8NJk3FXDvfW97KZWF2XTt87W3HQt2N1FP23gW4PqSm24Kw3gHW8wmwSZ1JSD3SW5kb93X6QnmswW9bFWTc7bqRGFW8Trt8g2bTmZtW6D3-c291pywBW8XfDvs3M2TnsW64l2dB15pRwvW20RcsH7qH6ZyN4RYnNh1lS27f7\_p18404 )
For today, head over to Motion, and let's find your top performing ads:
1. +Create report → Top performing
2. Select date range
Choose a preset (ex. last month, last 90 days, etc.) or pick an exact time frame. We like last 14 days.
3. Group by… (choose one)
- Ad name
- Creative (choose this option if you are running dynamic creative)
4. Add filters
Tell Motion which ads to pull in and which ones to leave out.
Check out filters for “performance metrics” for a ton of options. You’ll be able to set minimums and qualifiers here to clarify what “top performing” means to you. (ie. ROAS > 2.5).
5. Customize your report
Add more metrics to view, change the chart type (card view is my fave), play around with table settings, conditional formatting, reorder or delete columns…go wild here.
📌 Don’t forget to save (top right) this report! After customizing it to your needs, you’ll be able to come back anytime to view updates.
Bonus! Duplicate for different objectives
Have a campaign with different goals? Duplicate this report and update filters to look at top performers by product line, funnel stage, geo, etc.
Watch us do this!

Hi Team,
Thank you for the time today - it is always so much fun to be together in
person! Looking forward to carrying that forward as we head into H2!
Billy and I will be in Kansas City with another customer until next
Wednesday. However, we have availability on Thursday and Friday of next
week to meet and discuss lower funnel refinement. Please let us know which
day and time works best for the team and I’ll send over an invite!
I have made an initial list of follow up “homework” for each team to keep
us honest until I have a working Joint Business Plan for us to all work
against. Please let me know if there are any additional items you'd like to
include.
\*Google Team:\*
- YouTube Creative Audit

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| |  | | --- | | Looking for a better way to connect with shoppers and turn engagement into sales? Micro Ingredients, a top wellness brand, started using TikTok Shop’s free Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool to reach shoppers during key moments and drive repeat purchases. As a result, they've generated $261K in GMV in just 30 days. | |

| |  | | --- | | 🫐  How Micro Ingredients Uses CRM | |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| |  | | --- | | Before CRM, Will Shi, who leads Operations at Micro Ingredients, wasn't sure if their messages were reaching customers. They needed a tool that could target the right shoppers and send personalized messages to them at the right time. | |

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| |  | | --- | | Today, they use CRM to:  * Recover abandoned carts and highlight price drops * Promote new product launches and build excitement around sales events * Drive urgency with private coupons and limited-time offers |  |  |  | | --- | --- | | |  | | --- | |  | | |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| |  | | --- | | **💡 Top Tips from Micro Ingredients**  * **Lead with the offer:**    ""We want to make the incentives very obvious and very eye catching. In the title, we use hook words like '50% off,' 'big steals,' 'don't miss out,' or 'limited time only.'"" * **Personalize your messages:**    ""For new customers, we'll offer coupons and showcase our hero products. For returning customers, we focus on promoting new arrivals."" * **Use CRM to drive LIVE event attendance:**    ""We'll send messages before or during LIVE events, so shoppers can either register or jump right into the livestream if it's already started."" | |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| |  | | --- | | With CRM, Micro Ingredients has been able to connect with the right customers at the right time, improve engagement, and are getting better results from every campaign. | |

Hey Jourdan 👋
You've got 1 day left to run premium tasks for free! Try a bunch now to see who you want to add to your team.
Once access expires, you'll be able to purchase any of the agents for $25/mo per workspace.
That means it's your last chance to:
✅ Remix your top-performing ads
✅ Find vetted creators without doom-scrolling Instagram
✅ Turn high-potential clips into new hooks
✅ Get messaging feedback that actually helps

Hey Jourdan,
Savannah Sanchez is taking the Motion stage next month to reveal her top-performing ad formats this Summer.
As one of North America's top TikTok Creative Exchange partners, Savannah and her team have worked with hundreds of brands, producing top-performing ads for household names like Fabletics, Athletic Greens, and Dr. Squatch.
These ideas are out-of-the-box, scroll-stopping, and based on real winning ads from The Social Savannahs' ever-growing client list.
You’ll learn how to execute Savannah's winning ad formats, including:
- Which formats to use for different types of products
- How to capture audience attention in the first second
- Unconventional ways to create UGC ads that stand out
Join us for the live event to ask questions and get tailored advice straight from Savannah.
Can’t make the event live? Register anyway. You’ll be the first to get the recording and any companion resources shared during the event.
📅 Wednesday, July 2 @ 11am PST | 2pm EST

2025-06-18T11:52:00,slack,User_7DB7H9,sb-higherdose-creative,message,@Anastasia I think we can either 1) get her content up asap only on Instagram (thus beginning the 60 days usage) or 2) we can wait and you can go back to her to ask for Meta and TikTok in order to maximize those 60 days of usage! We have not put spend behind the organic Instagram post just yet as the moment we do that the 60 days usage starts and I wanted to ensure clarity before we set that live. Please let us know which option above you prefer and we can move forward accordingly. Thank you so much Anastasia! cc @Laura @User_PT7LCE @Berkeley Clark

Hi Tori,
Great meeting you guys yesterday! Confirming the following from my end:
\*HigherDOSE Team:\*
- \*Scale existing PMAX budgets to capitalize on incredible performance
from the month - \*Scaled all campaigns to recommended budgets. This is
an increase of \*$2,683.87+ daily\* on Google cc: @Berkeley Clark
 @Ingrid Milman Cordy 
- \*Implement NCA goals within PMAX campaigns - \*This is also done. Just
one thing. Mind clarifying what the incremental conversion value for new
customers mean in the attached screenshot and how that'll help us track the
impact of this NCA test?
Hope everyone has a great day off!
Best,
Rahul.

Stop Killing Your Video Views: Fix These Common Video Mistakes

| |  |  | | --- | --- | | |  | | --- | |  | | |

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| |  | | --- | | #Issue 1.   Still Frames & GIFs | | Notice the problem? The video lacks the vibrant energy that TikTok thrives on. Static images and GIFs are a snoozefest.    ✅ To truly succeed on TikTok, embrace dynamic formats and create videos that are visually captivating and undeniably engaging. |  |  |  | | --- | --- | | |  | | --- | |  | | |

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| |  |  | | --- | --- | | |  | | --- | |  | |  |  | | --- | | #Issue 2.  Inappropriate Video Splicing with Product Details Page (PDPs) Image | | Leave your Product Detail Pages (PDPs) out of the spotlight! Avoid misleading edits that can damage trust. Instead, showcase your product's uniqueness through captivating multi-angle demos.    ✅ Clearly demonstrate its features, benefits, and problem-solving capabilities! | |

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| |  | | --- | | #Issue 3.  Irrelevant Promotions | | Is your shoppable video's message clear? You risk alienating viewers with irrelevant content or blatant cross-promotion.    ✅ Leverage shoppable video to showcase your product and drive direct sales – don't sabotage your success! |  |  |  | | --- | --- | | |  | | --- | |  | | |

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| |  |  | | --- | --- | | |  | | --- | |  | |  |  | | --- | | #Issue 4.  Insufficient Product Description | | This video only showed the bag from one angle and lacked product descriptions. Do your videos suffer from the same problem? TikTok closely examines how you present your products in your videos.    ✅ To maximize your reach and conversions, your shoppable videos should clearly showcase key features, benefits, and usage from various angles. | |

This makes it easier for sellers to identify and address issues promptly.  **📈 Monitor product performance** : GMV, units sold, and product views are now displayed directly in *Manage Products* page, giving sellers quick access to performance insights without leaving the page.  **💲 Drive growth with smarter task cards** : Task cards are powered by in-house data and algorithms and can help improve GMV when sellers complete the suggested actions.    We've built this update with you in mind, so you can spend less time navigating tools and more time growing your business. Check out our [feature guide](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ7lKCO4uRLe) to explore everything that's new.    Best,  TikTok Shop | |

Hi Jourdan,
There are 3 easy ways to share your findings in Motion:
1. Copy + paste
Right-click on any element to copy it to your clipboard. Paste into slide decks or docs to share with your team or clients.
2. Download video ads as gifs
Finally! A solution to putting video ads into slides 🙏 Just download and insert.
3. Share full reports
Top right → click “Share report”
Add notes or @mention people to add context, then just copy the link and share.
Bonus: Because we know how frustrating building slide decks can be…we created a slide deck template (https://content.motionapp.com/e3t/Ctc/GF+113/d2hYgB04/VWnjfh5pX2YXW98q10R3p0SFqW35KrPN5y1nKNN6rgBpH5m\_5PW69t95C6lZ3nLVc-Bx43PKWYwW8zj0qv1DcWHlW8LMtQq45nPzXN6JLVfSgd\_NcW7l9Vzq5sd2lzVKXzzk8-rYd4V7T4RT2Zqpd8VWs1RB7h0q6jW8CMnCf2ylN7\_W1HJzMD7T3YnjN2695HzjfGF9VHHSrG2xkPNrW4BkCmc91xGBsVWBbLD8f8-sPN7BWV5GpDZYXW6fSlfh8PvFthW10Wr212\_DR9WW18R9hQ1n5N7bW1pq4vj1P9zs8W3mT3178sDQ7JW2Q5TqW501dtNW6N0Gwj6GFJH5V4Nwm44MSQPKMKZLb-PwgCvW2fXlx18XG3SXW5wNK2b4l72z2W4bB4gD8TT4X4W7MWY7m10C7nrW2Gjx\_X8N2tJKW8m-Vgc8R0x-kW1yzG1C38X6ZGW3PfPYL6v0GrxW3JCB8Q68dRlxW7d3S\_Q3MmNzRW6QxXn46VPQV3W7RQ-h73dt2Ljf1Vw-ld04 ) for you with all the Motion report types you might want to share 😘

Hey Jourdan,
Welcome to our marketing nurture program.
There’s no point in hiding it — you know how the game is played just as well as we do.
So here’s the truth:
- I’m Reza Khadjavi, the CEO and founder of Motion. I wrote most of this nurture content and Brock, my Growth Manager, edited it and built this distribution channel on HubSpot.
- I know a bit about you. I built Motion because I talked to performance people just like you who were managing multi-million dollar ad budgets on razor-thin margins but were struggling to collect and analyze valuable feedback on their biggest performance lever: creative.
- Over the next 12 emails, I’m going to show you how to build a creative strategy at HigherDOSE that will lead to the production of more winning ads and, in turn, more revenue.
And if you’re more inclined to try Motion at the end of this, that’s just a bonus.
Sound valuable? If not, feel free to opt out — we aren’t in the business of pestering.
If you’re interested, you can expect your next email to arrive tomorrow, so you can get a taste of the style and format. After that, every following email will be delivered in ten-day increments.
Or if you want to get the content faster — reply to this email and we’ll opt you into our express track. We’ll send you an email every three days so you can increase your learning velocity.
Talk soon,
Reza Khadjavi

Lesson 1: A 3min crash course on creative strategy

At the heart of everything Motion is a fundamental belief: the biggest lever in paid ads today is creative.

Hey Jourdan,
At the heart of everything Motion is a fundamental belief: the biggest lever in paid ads is creative, therefore, creative strategy is the secret to creating more winning ads.
That’s why I want to spend our first nurture email giving you a crash course on creative strategy. It should be a 3-minute read. 👇
1. Memorize this definition
I’m not big on definitions, but this is one you really need to internalize:
Creative strategy is the process of combining design with data to produce creative that achieves marketing goals. It bridges the art of storytelling with the science of optimization, ensuring every creative delivers maximum impact.
To help you remember:
- Design + data
- Art + science
- Right brain + left brain
2. Learn the creative strategy flywheel
The creative strategy flywheel is the framework that the best advertisers use to create more winning ads.
It looks like this:
Whether you have a formal process in place or not, you likely use a variation of this framework at HigherDOSE.
I’m not going to walk you through each step, but I want to focus on a couple.
3. Creative Analysis is probably your bottleneck
The distance between you and your performance goals is likely the same as the gap between your creative analysis and ideation stages.
Ask yourself a few questions:
- When you launch new creatives, do you have clear tests in mind?
- Are these tests being assessed based on the right metrics (ex. A high thumbstop is good, but a high thumbstop with a high CTR is better).
- Do these test results translate into clear feedback to inform your next round of creative briefs?
- Are you delivering this feedback to your creative team in a format they can understand?
To master creative analysis, you need to set clear goals for every ad creative and hold yourself to a very high standard when assessing those ads.
4. If not Creative Analysis, then it’s 100% Content Creation
The next biggest issue that advertisers typically face is creative velocity.
The greater the volume of creative you can move, the more data you can funnel back into your creative strategy, and the more likely you are to hit your next winner.
In other words — you need to opt for speed over production quality. Hifi content has a place, but not until you’re putting out a pile of iPhone videos edited with CapCut every week.
But this is just the tip of the iceberg. We formed a category and built Motion around this advertising challenge. And we’re still learning every day.
If you want to learn more about creative strategy, here are a few resources:

Defintely can do that - and nice to meet you Jourdan, congrats on joining
the team.
Any chance Wednesday would work for 30 minutes? Scheduled travels
on Thursday/Friday.
I can be flexible anytime outside of 2:30pm PST. If not, happy to share
over more times for next week.
Once confirmed, @Charlene will follow up with an invite.
Best,
Mike

| --- | --- |
| |  | | --- | | Hi HigherDOSE Shop,    We have an exciting update for you on Product Subscriptions on TikTok Shop.    As a quick reminder, Product Subscriptions allow you to offer discounts to buyers who choose to subscribe to repeat purchases of select products in your shop.    **Key benefits of Product Subscriptions include:**  * Increased Shopper Loyalty   : Product Subscriptions help keep shoppers returning by offering convenience and savings on frequently purchased items. * Boosted Sales   : Secure consistent, repeat sales from customers with recurring orders * Improved Inventory Planning   : Recurring orders allow more accurate demand forecasting and effective inventory management | |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| |  |  | | --- | --- | | |  | | --- | |  | | |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| |  | | --- | | We are also announcing a new addition to Product Subscriptions: **First Order Discounts**.    This allows you to set a customized discount for first-time subscribers that is just a little sweeter than the standard, recurring subscription discount to encourage more sellers to subscribe. | |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| |  |  | | --- | --- | | |  | | --- | |  | | |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| |  | | --- | | **To activate Product Subscriptions for your products:**   1. Navigate to **Manage Products**    in Seller Center and choose the product(s) you want to have subscriptions on 2. Hover over **More**    in the action column, and select **Set subscription** 3. Toggle **Activate product subscription** on 4. Set the desired discount rate and acknowledge the free shipping option for subscription products 5. To add a ""New customer discount,"" enter the desired percentage 6. Click **Confirm**   That’s it! You’re officially on your way to selling more.    This feature is limited to sellers in certain categories so click the feature guide link below to learn more. | |

MNTN | HigherDOSE - Recap

## Body

Hey Ingrid and Jourdan,
Thanks for taking the time to chat today and learn about MNTN. Excited to
prove this channel out for you and drive new business.
To recap, we're able to put unskippable ads in front of your target
audience (MNTN Matched, Site Visitors, CRM Email lists) while they watch
their favorite shows on premium networks & apps like Peacock, ESPN and
ABC. \*Most
important part is that it's all optimized and measurable down to the site
visit and conversion\*.
I've linked the deck we went through, case studies, and our creative best
practices and specs sheet for review. I've also included resources on how
our clients leverage third party attribution tools like Northbeam. Doesn't
look like we've worked with the team over at Sharma Brands before, but we
would be happy to catch them up to speed if you decide to loop them in.
I have a note to follow up with you on Wednesday next week. If we have the
green-light, I can go ahead and create the HigherDOSE account in the MNTN
platform and send over logins to begin the set up process for a Q3 launch.
Let me know if you have any questions in the meantime!
Links to resources:
- Inventory
- Targeting
- Attribution Model
- Sending Data to 3rd Party Attribution Tools
- MNTN Value Deck - 2025
- CASE STUDY - Tuckernuck
- CASE STUDY - Princess Polly
- CTV Video Creative Best Practices
Cheers,
Brian Fritsche

Get started
Once you’ve set up a channel for your project, create a project overview canvas and save it to your channel so everyone stays on the same page.
Within your canvas you can:
-
Bring together key information by adding files, images, and videos
-
Keep stakeholders informed by using @mentions
-
Respond quickly to questions or comments with emoji reactions

| |  | | --- | | Hi HigherDOSE Shop,    Deals for You Days is coming, and it's your shot at blockbuster sales. To make the most of this moment, you'll want a motivated creator team getting your deals noticed.    Your sampling strategy is key to getting creators excited, and with Refundable Samples, you can add another powerful, performance-driven tool just in time for the upcoming summer campaign.    Refundable Samples is one of the simplest ways to get more of your products in the hands of creators when it matters most, creating a performance-driven ecosystem where creators are motivated to drive actual sales and aren't waiting for their free sample requests to come through.    This summer, don't just hope for sales. Go get them. | |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| |  | | --- | | With refundable samples, sellers can see:  * **25% higher ROI**   compared to traditional free sample programs\* * **Controlled marketing spend** with refunds tied directly to sales * **Reduced risk** when testing new creator segments   *\*Source: TikTok Shop Sample Analysis US, Feb-March 2025* | |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| |  | | --- | | **Making the change before Deals for You Days is simple:**  1. Go to Affiliate Center. 2. Under Open collaborations, find Offer Samples. 3. Toggle on refundable samples and set your sales threshold. | |

Hey Jourdan,
We'd love to have Ingrid on this call as well just because we'll have some
discussion points based on previous conversations with the Google team.
Could you share your's and Ingrid's availability next week so we can lock
in a slot early?
Best,
Rahul.

Here are some ideas for creating a comparative analysis in Motion, plus a bonus ad naming template to keep your campaigns organized!

Hi Jourdan,
When you click on “+Create new” on the left sidebar in Motion, you’ll have the option to create two different types of reports:
- Top performing
- Comparative analysis
Let’s do a comparative analysis today → this report allows you to compare multiple sets of creatives against one another.
Some ideas for comparative reports:
- Product 1 vs. Product 2
- Offer 1 vs. Offer 2 vs. Offer 3
- Talent A vs. Talent B vs. Talent C
- And on, and on, and on…
Keep in mind: If you’re comparing different assets, you’ll want to make sure your ad naming conventions are as clear as possible from the get-go. This way, you can easily find different ads to compare.
I learned this the hard way 😏 so I built this ad naming template (https://content.motionapp.com/e3t/Ctc/GF+113/d2hYgB04/VWlZ1n8w29PbN2D7lx52z3ZqW9fbdmV5yd5r4N2XT73C5m\_5PW5BWr2F6lZ3kDW5By30P9lqjX9W7GP3rK1r9zgDW2KmJn85dTDQqW1PpFG-2-bf-XW7-DLWp6tdhcQW9hBJXG5LWHgwW2D810B7frksjW4rYcdC8Jh\_YNW4Qj1Ld27VfvGV6zkmv11xflyW6rP48z27ZQ6FW2Sv42D6RR1W3W4hfLwn6YTz1dW2VK6Lr90V2qGW7DRW8w6kxnDcW59lchq7-BS4KW2lLffD1YPz1wW3kvYMY8WHdPDW63gLjs3Ft\_gFW3dndn-52zPjcW1gFhbL24Jf5SW3q4TPC8Ch14lN3z7jPVR7rFJW5jQTqf2F0db9W5HYhy-8BPlQvW1-0pYH6hphptN4bclrFWZv7PW1QR13v8cHk-nW4CJyn33yBWCMW6YNXxW6Kg33CW3fTNwT1Td4grW3C7Cxv1mJkVqW943wVp3kKNr\_W7qFdk97BNL4wf1kTGSq04 ) just for you!

2025-06-25T11:46:00,slack,Laura,sb-higherdose-creative,message,I think our handle is actually fine it’s just how our name appears? 
2025-06-25T11:51:00,slack,User_TS27JN,sb-higherdose-creative,message,Hey @Laura just to clarify do you mean you've submitted changing the name and have been rejected or looking for other handle ideas?  The actual handle itself appears as 'Higherdose'. I do know when we post/spark the name appears as higherdose shop to users so happy to look into changing that!
2025-06-25T11:51:00,slack,Laura,sb-higherdose-creative,message,Yes we need to change higherdose shop - is that an easy fix or do we need to submit again?  
2025-06-25T11:52:00,slack,Laura,sb-higherdose-creative,message,I wasn’t the one submitting so I’m not suuuper clear but we want our name to appear the same as our handle too and read “HigherDOSE” if we have the option to capitalize the dose 
2025-06-25T11:52:00,slack,Laura,sb-higherdose-creative,message,We are going to up our community engagement so also want it to reflect for that as well. Thanks!!

Please see [here](https://support.tiktok.com/en/getting-started/setting-up-your-profile/changing-your-nickname) for directions how to change it. Its a nickname assigned to the account that can be changed once every 7 days. Let me know if you run into an issue changing it and I can confirm on my end the ads changed once its tweaked!

Ad-vetorials for each of our products

## Body

Hey Jourdan and Elyse,
Wanted to connect you both here to help work on creating some ad-vetorials
for each of our products. Jourdan, you can show Elyse what these look like
from your previous days, but it's a combination of a shoppable page and a
blog post that we would push out into paid media.
Let me know how I can help but think you guys can take it from here. I'd of
course like you to share your thoughts/plan with me when you're ready -
perhaps we aim for week of July 7 to review?
Thanks,
Ingrid

Hey Chris,
We're currently working with our Google reps on an exercise to calculate
the breakeven ROAS and CPA targets by product/category, so we can apply
more tailored goals to those specific campaigns, on Google.
We've put together a sheet with all the inputs needed for the
calculation [linked

,
and would love for you to take a quick look to make sure everything looks
accurate so the calculations will be spot on.
Let us know if any info on this sheet seems way off and needs to be
changed.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| |  | | --- | | Hi HigherDOSE Shop! | | Are you looking to sell products from two or more brands? We've just introduced a new **Co-Branding/Licensing** submission option for brand authorization in **Seller Center**. | | If this applies to your shop, we recommend submitting your co-branding or licensing documents to ensure compliance and unlock benefits — like the Authorized Seller badge on your listings. | |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| |  | | --- | | **What does the Co-Branding/Licensing option do?** | |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| |  | | --- | | * You can sell products created in collaboration with two or more brands * You can hold official licensing agreements to use another brand's intellectual property | |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| |  | | --- | | **What are the next steps?** | | If you **DON'T** have the necessary rights to list the products, please remove the affected listings to avoid further violations. | | If you **DO** have valid licensing or co-branding agreements, submit your documentation using the following steps: | | 1. Go to **Seller Center**    then to **My Account** 2. Click **Account** **Settings** 3. Then click**Qualification Center** 4. Go to**Brand Authorization** 5. Under the **Brand qualification** tab, click    ""Add brand authorization"" 6. Select the **Co-Branding/Licensing** option | | Or you can click the button below to be taken there directly. | | |  | | --- | | [Submit Co-Branding/Licensing Documents](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ7v7tH4xLtn) | | |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| |  | | --- | | To learn more about brand authorization or intellectual property rights, please refer to the linked TikTok Shop Academy articles below: | | |  | | --- | | [Guide to Obtaining Brand Authorization](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ7v7tH5EOvI) | | | |  | | --- | | [Intellectual Property Policy: Brand Authorization](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ7v7tH5VRxp) | | | Thank you for your partnership, | | TikTok Shop | |

Re: Google Unit Economics

I will review by end of weekend but
- Is the inclusion of tax rate because Google just sees total order value
inclusive?
- Should there be inclusion of actual average selling value given the high
proclivity of discount codes being used (even during non-sale)

Jourdan - great to connect today; refreshing how quickly you picked up on
the value and utitlization of our platform.
Our team, alongsider SB will help you leverage Prescient alongside MTA; as
mentioned, 95% or more of our clients triangulate their measurement using
MTA+MMM.
Please find attached the ""business case"" outlining key objectives we'll
collectively work together throughout the partnership.
Also, per the request of Sumish, I've reduced the opt-out from 6 months to
5 months, and reflected that in the Order Form.
If this looks good, please let us know who to send via DocuSign and
@Kristen Bricker (Ops team) will share.
Excited to get started.

Thanks, Rahul. Appreciate the summary and plan. @jourdan will you weigh in?

Re: Google Unit Economics

And also the point of the exercise getting to breakeven is what? Obviously
we don't target that in spend and by making that the metric you're
introducing things like return rates

Re: Google Unit Economics

## Body

Hey Chris,
The goal here is to calculate breakeven ROAS and CPA targets by
product/category so we can set more tailored and realistic goals for each
campaign on Google. The Google team needs unit economics by
product/category to do this.
For example, if the breakeven ROAS for the Red Light Mask is 2.0, we’d
likely set the campaign target ROAS at ~3 — giving it room to scale without
sacrificing profitability. This helps ensure we’re not capping performance
with overly aggressive targets, while still keeping things efficient.
Hope that clears things up! Let me know if you'd like more detail — happy
to loop in the Google reps as well.
Best,
Rahul

Google Check In Post Scaling (since 6/19)

## Body

Hi Ingrid,Following the scale-up of our Google campaigns on June 19 (based
on platform recommendations), I wanted to share a quick update on
performance and what we’re seeing so far:
- \*Spend is up ~40%\*, and \*clicks have more than doubled (+90%)\*,
showing strong traffic growth.
- However, \*conversions are down ~23%\*, which we believe is due to a few
key factors:
- \*Conversion lag\* (due to HD’s higher AOV): Many recent clicks
likely haven’t had time to convert yet.
- \*CVR is down ~21%\*, likely driven by mid-funnel behavior
(consideration phase), macro factors, and users potentially
holding out for
July 4th promos.
- \*Campaign learning phase\*: With last week’s budget adjustments,
performance dips are expected until campaigns exit learning and
stabilize.
(Reps are recommending a ~30-day window to fully exit learning.)
- On a positive note, \*CPCs are down ~26%\*, suggesting the algorithm is
finding more efficient traffic.
- Within \*PMax\* (where most of the scale happened), \*3 out of 5
campaigns saw a lift in conversions\*, though overall ROAS dipped due to
volatility in others.
- Early signs indicate PMax is leaning more into \*broader upper-funnel
placements (e.g., video views)\* to capture new users who may convert
over time (screenshot attached from the reps).
\*Recommended next steps\* (aligned with both Billy and Tori):
We suggest giving the campaigns until early next week to allow for late
conversions. We’ll coordinate a call with our Google reps to review
everything in detail. From there, we’ll plan to \*scale down any campaigns
not driving incremental revenue\* after accounting for late attribution.
That said, we’re happy to downscale sooner if you'd prefer — just let us
know what you’d like to do, and I’ll grab time slots from the Google team
for next week.Best,
Rahul"

I’m aligned here. Give it more time for performance to back out but if
we’re not seeing lift after next week let’s pull back until we get drive
higher efficiency and volume on meta.

Re: Google Unit Economics

I think it would be helpful if we had a call for me to review a related
file here to refine this because - recognizing we can't get too complicated
- I think we would miss something in not figuring out how to capture
bundles and packages
Examples being
- 30% of all revenue is bundles
- More ""blanket only"" sales include inserts vs not

Some people who engage with businesses on Messenger will see a new screen explaining how information from that chat, such as messages and actions, might be used by Meta to improve their experience. This may include improving response times, ads and features like translations and AI. However, this doesn't change our long-standing policy that we do not sell people's information and never will. | |  |  |  | | --- | | People can access information about their business chat privacy and data use any time by tapping on the business' name at the top of a chat and selecting **Privacy information**. | |  |  |  | | --- | | The information described in the new disclosure is different from [business activities](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1176420112997278), such as lead status and labels, which businesses can choose to share with Meta through Meta Business Suite or other business tools. | |  | | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | --- | | Read more about how chats between businesses and people work on Messenger. | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | [|  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | |  | | | |  | [Help Center](https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/5027636907313972) |  | |  | | |](https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/5027636907313972) | |  | | |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | --- | | For further questions, contact customer support or visit our Support Center. | |  | | |  |   |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | --- | | **Thank you,** | |  | | |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | --- | | **The Meta Team** | |  | | |  | | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | --- | | This email was sent to jourdan@higherdose.com.

Re: Ad-vetorials for each of our products

## Body

Hey Elyse,
Here's a few examples I've sent Ingrid regarding advertorials.
This one is inline with the shoppale page and blog post
https://agelesslx.com/pages/bye-bye-soft-body-wrinkled-sagging-skin/
Here are X reasons why advertorial examples. Often referred to as
listicle style advertorials.
https://groundingforce.com/pages/article-10-reasons-why
https://www.getquip.com/pages/9-reasons-everyone-is-upgrading-to-quip
https://theearthlingco.com/pages/5-reasons-why-shampoo-bar-conditioner-bar-free-soap-dish
Here's the traditional style advertorial that educates before sending them
to a shoppable experience
https://eskiin.com/pages/advertorial-2
https://about.getbugmd.com/bugmdwb/?lpv=BugMD-Facebook-BST(Control)-08-31-22
https://about.clarifion.com/?lpv=CLF-OG-FB-LP%28A4-VIDEO-GALORE-GRNBTN%29-06-09-25&atfimg=
Here's an article from GemPages breaking down different advertorial
approaches to give more ideas around potential layout.
https://gempages.net/blogs/shopify/gempages-advertorial-template
I'm aligned with Ingrid on creating a shoppable + blog post style page.
That is a newer trend so a little harder to find working examples
Thank you,
Jourdan Smith

Re: Checkmate

Hey Anastasia,
Thanks for sending this over. I am curious about how they get paid. It
shows $149/month + 15% CPA which I'm not sure if they're taking 15% of the
average CPA driven so more clarity on that would be nice.
I think its worth having a conversation with them to figure out more.
Thank you,

Re: Checkmate

There is no monthly fee - they will waive it for us.
They work through our affiliate platform and receive a 15% commission on
all sales they generate. It's a month-to-month thing, so we can cancel
anytime. I've had a few conversations with them already, but Ingrid wants
you to look into it as well. I'd be happy to set up another call with them.

Hi Chris,
Makes a ton of sense. We'll be connecting w/ our Google reps this week and
we can certainly add you to that call to discuss this in detail. I'm still
waiting to finalize a date and time for our chat. Will make sure to check
in on your availability too, before finalizing things.

Hey Katie!
Due to our current spend levels, there are only two ads
that have spent $3k over this 7 day period, here's
a look at ads that have spent $750 or more this past week if we were to
raise the threshold slightly.

Re: Weekly Updates 6/27 | Sharma x HD

## Body

Thanks for looping me in Ari!
I'm glad Meta North Beam metrics are improving and exciting to see CAC
below $1k with spend & efficiency up. Hopefully that continues to improve
this week.
Google performance was expected with the increase in spend and the platform
taking more time to respond to those types of changes. Excited to see how
this week plays out and hopefully proves our theory that Google can scale
independently of Meta w/ so much search demand.
I'm surprised TikTok low AOV is struggling this much but curious to see how
high AOV performs since we're seeing good results across multiple channels
with Red Light Hat.
We'll discuss more on today's call!

| |  |  | | --- | --- | | |  | | --- | | Hi Seller,  **We've upgraded how your Shopify discounts sync to TikTok Shop** , so you can now optimize this feature for better results. As **""Deals For You Days""** approaches, review the changes and update your setup to capitalize on this big shopping event.  Key Things to Know Your Shopify discounts automatically appear in TikTok Shop, but they work a bit differently:   * **Discount codes become automatic**   - those with no usage limit and no targeting will be auto applied. Customers don't need to enter codes. * **Only ""all customers"" discounts sync**   - we do not sync any that have specific targeting set in Shopify. * **Usage limit syncing is updated** - see our [easy view guide](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ80jwbxD3SK)   for specific details on which purchase requirements and discount usages sync based on promotion type. * **Discount combination syncing has changed** - see our [easy view guide](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ80jwbxD3SK) for specific details.   Not all discount types work - some sync perfectly, others need adjustments to sync. What You Need to Do  1. **Read our**     **[detailed feature guide](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ80jwbxl9WO)**    to understand how discount sync works and how to optimize 2. **Go to your**     **[TikTok for Shopify app](https://accounts.shopify.com/lookup?rid=bea846e6-4499-44b5-b61f-ce4252f758e0&verify=1741209111-XRh3BKbhruERSltpaCJPJ6Id3Y6o6QwD3x5j2JOj4Nk%3D)**     **> Marketing > Promotion Sync** to:  1. Check your current discounts 2. Review what's syncing 3. Optimize your strategy and activate the best discounts for your business   Let's make this your biggest sales event yet!    Best,  TikTok Shop Team | | |

Hi Jourdan,
Here’s how to find creative iteration opportunities in Motion:
Create a new top performing report → filter for:
- Hook score below <70
- Convert score above >70
- Set your spend threshold (i.e. spend above $100)
Then, +add metrics to your display → hook score and convert score.
Switch to card view and organize by hook score → lowest to highest.
Go change the hook on these ads 🏃
Need some inspo?
+Create a new top performing report and filter for hook score above >70 to see what’s worked best for your ads in the past.

Fwd: Weekly Recap

## Body

Hi Jourdan,
This is an example more detailed summary that our previous Growth
Strategist shared weekly to help me understand how they were spending their
time and overall how the business was performing. We can work on a
better/cleaner format but I'd like to get all these updates and clarity on
a weekly basis.
I'd you to begin sharing with me at either the start or end of each week.
Would I'd like is to align on a date where you deliver this each week (you
tell me what's ideal) and then we will book our weekly touchbase to review.
Let me know if you have any questions and what day of the week works best
for you for this review.
Best,
Ingrid

-Daily monitoring of Facebook ads
-Consistent requests for content both static and video from team members
-Creative analysis + performance analysis daily
-Need to launch YouTube Ads (backlog)
-Need better support resource for tiktok ads.
-RFP for agencies/reopening conversations, discussed pricing with PDM

create based on how well bundles have done on ads for us \*(on hold)\*
-Red Light Mask campaign optimizations, even though the red light mask is a

deeper audit to understand why the ads do not reflect our sales in Shopify

in motion (urgent)
\*Affiliate\*
-Need you to provide weekly touchbase with Anastasia to align on
whitelisting cadence and testing/performance
\*Motion/creative reporting\*

creative performance more consistently.
\*Website Landing/CRO Optimizations\*
Currently working on Red light mask testing
Homepage hero testing
AOV impact on shop all collection merchandising
\*Challenges with Ads\*
Creative keeps getting blamed for account performance, but I have continued
to talk and request Alex make changes to his structure or his approach.
There's a reason why he says the old creative keeps winning — its because
they have had enough time to learn, optimize and test.
With CPA targets at ~$150, a $100 ad spend between split between 2 does not
give it enough time to learn or budget to test out.
Here are some examples:
""The new ad creative does not work""
Here are the results and amount of spend used to determine this.
Too much creative at once:
The red light hat launch had 15 creatives live with $250 in ad spend. In
order to reach statistical significance at that level of spend would take
at least 10 days which would be out of their preferred attribution window.
I had him bump up the budget to $500/day and pare down the creative. We are
now at 8 creatives at $500/day with learning limited.
Trend for ad is typically it will be high at first because it needs time to
identify what type of customer would engage, react or purchase from this ad
and then it gets better at pinpointing the target consumer for that ad.
This is why testing typically takes 2 weeks at an appropriate spend. The
only ones with purchases here are ones that have spent enough to cover our
CPA.
When I first asked him to pare this down, he had all static no video which
you can see are the two in this account that have purchases and enough
spend.
His proposed memorial day. Plan — I"

Re: MNTN | HigherDOSE - Recap

Hey Ingrid and Jourdan - I know I said Wednesday, but wanted to make sure I
got a note out before the holiday kicks in :) How have conversations gone
internally so far?
Recapping the test strategy we discussed:
- Target launch Aug 1st
- Initial testing flight of 2 months Aug-Sep
- $15k/mo
- Targeting: MNTN Matched Keywords (new to brand) + CRM (email lists)
- Support: Dedicated Customer Engagement Manager
Anything that should be updated here? Happy to create your account in
platform and loop in your support manager to kick off the set up process -
look forward to hearing back!

Re: Weekly Updates 6/27 | Sharma x HD

## Body

Hey Ingrid,
Here’s a quick snapshot of Demand Gen MTD (June 8–29):
- Spend: $8,673.51
- CPM: $11.41 ($9.42 in ToF ad group)
- Conversions (platform comparable): 23
- CPA (platform comparable): $377.11
- Revenue (platform comparable): $13,494.45
- ROAS (platform comparable): 1.56
- View-through conversions: 1,551
Results for the launch month look promising. As we move into July, we’ll be
refining our Demand Gen/YouTube setup after syncing with our Google reps.
Note: ""Platform comparable"" metrics reflect attribution similar to paid
social, and Google reps suggest this gives a truer view of Demand Gen
performance.
For June, we worked with a $9K budget ($300/day). Let us know what budget
can be allocated for July.
Best,
Rahul

Lesson 2: Audience targeting has been eaten by AI

## Body

Creative has become your targeting and creative testing is your mechanism to reach your audience.

Hey Jourdan,
This week, let’s talk about the evolution of ad targeting.
You used to build your ad audiences in Ads Manager. You probably remember those days. It was the wild west of media buying. You could target users by insane attributes, like income levels by zip code, spending patterns, or sensitive health interests.
But those days are no more. Audience targeting has been eaten by AI.
I know this because — before Motion — I tried to build an app to create more elaborate journey mapping in ad audiences.
We quickly realized that we were fighting the evolution of the algorithm and we needed to go a different direction.
So we turned to the best of the best, media buyers for the biggest Shopify ecommerce brands in the world. People like Connor MacDonald (https://content.motionapp.com/e3t/Ctc/GF+113/d2hYgB04/MX70Gyf7\_Q9W6xdRNw3HDfPWVDyhz95ywPR1N61zzVR3prCCW8wLKSR6lZ3pzW2f-CW07FbyG4W4zmPSt91FZ6NW4PTBvF8QnX26W1hl\_rS7gX-\_TW5bpJ6P8ysYBCW74RH6s1vT0m1W5M3tzf4fdBB2W4TVzQ432dWtmW1hmw3z9g52HPW5lmmZf7gYc7XW3Bz0d64R5kPsF4SkjhQW41sW6cCcdh1Rlv\_fW7cHd0M30DtL9W92N19P23rcwKW4-l7Ns4skB7QW18Zl4t2mtzLyW4zCDQ-1p0ykWW3RNKq-537GzHW4h\_92l2kggXlW4y5T4Z1jqS9BW5-Lv6G83XRCjW2lXxLY4nS44SW7y-QYZ8N\_ttFVplY091QxwFqW6nL3hc2lMQLHW8G2Z8T472dmXW1gDSx831ws99f53D4t204 ) who were managing multi-million dollar ad budgets on razor-thin margins.
We discovered that the biggest lever these advertisers were pulling to drive results was in creative testing.
It’s almost a return to the days of billboard advertising. You rent a billboard if you know that your target buyer/ICP will be walking/driving by it. You advertise on Meta to a broad audience and can pretty much trust that your ICP will see your ads.
That’s because your audience are the most likely people to engage with your ads and those engagement signals help Meta find more people who look like those that are already engaging. Before you know it, Meta is serving ads almost exclusively to your ICP.
So your focus should be singular: what message do I want to deliver to my ICP through my creative?
You might have theories about what the best message will be, but the only way to find out for sure is by running creative tests. Produce different statics, videos, gifs, carousels, and more. Run these with different ad copy, headlines, and CTA variants, and wait for your winners to emerge.
When they do, you’ll now have insights to inform the direction of new creative iterations and new concept development.
This is the beginning of your creative strategy flywheel (the bridge between step 7 and step 1).
There are a few ways to conduct this creative analysis:
- Ads Manager: With a good account setup, you’ll find some ad-level data easy to digest, like ROAS, CPA, and more.
- Spreadsheets: Export your account data, build pivot tables, and run comparative analyses across your entire body of ads.
- Motion (https://content.motionapp.com/e3t/Ctc/GF+113/d2hYgB04/MX70Gyf7\_Q9W6xdRNw3HDfPWVDyhz95ywPR1N61zzVd3prCCW7lCdLW6lZ3kTW7Pf0Dq7YlC8SW8Kl0CT9g851rW1g1Cdn31-9f\_W4z3kvZ3KZb8JW6lv43G5qy8-HW4xy\_6S6FgKy1W6Kb0j27VnQHGW4M1pq465tJ9bW8y2MqP1dr5zLW79wxLF4xY50PVzcXN32g-CvnN3bW6s6d\_-hDW7j6VSz15Pv-TW3QkxHQ6vDJQ\_W5Wk5Pl8RtFPdW7X2jJJ574JxDW5F6ZbM7JnsykW6dTQTx1K28HyW36Nh8P6M51p5W2zgGfJ7HBsMvW52c5Gk3XRG8gW6v56by70L6vhW1N3GFt1lM8ScW7Bh-9j6Tnj6cf8V7XWH04 ) : If you’re spending $50k+/month on ads, Motion simplifies this process dramatically—saving you time and giving you much deeper insights.
Once you’ve run your analysis, a new problem is typically born: you need to turn your data points into qualitative feedback that your creative team can leverage to build more winning ads.
In my next chapter, I’ll share some tactics you can leverage to break down this communication barrier and bring creative and analytics into harmony.

Hi Anastasia and Jourdan,
Great to connect with you today! Excited to get this partnership launched

Team Breathwork Sesh (information)

## Body

Hello team,

Hope everyone is experiencing a nourishing day so far!

A little deep dive of what’s happening when I guide my breathwork sessions paired with specific music to help give the best all round experience ✨

The science & spirit of my 3 part breathwork method 

Part 1: Inhale through the nose (4 sec), exhale through the mouth with a vibrational sigh (8 sec)

Science: This activates the parasympathetic nervous system, the part of us responsible for calm, rest, and digestion.

Body: The longer exhale lowers cortisol, relaxes your heart rate, and tells your body “you’re safe.”

Mind: It gently eases the brainwaves from a beta (alert) state into alpha (relaxed, meditative).

Soul: You’re grounding. Arriving. Reclaiming presence. This is the opening of the portal.

——————

Part 2: Double inhale through the mouth (expanding through the diaphragm, then expanding through the chest) → exhaling through mouth with a vibrational sigh

Science: This pattern floods the body with oxygen and lightly expels CO₂. The diaphragmatic + thoracic combo brings breath deeper into unused lung capacity.

Body: Oxygenating the blood and stimulating the vagus nerve for emotional release and cellular activation.

Mind: Begins to clear mental fog and awaken dormant clarity and emotion.

Soul: This opens the heart center. Stored emotions can now move and be felt.

——————

Part 3: Continuous, circular mouth breathing (no pauses at the top or bottom of the breath)

Science: This induces a mild respiratory alkalosis, a shift in blood pH that creates a dreamlike state, enhancing access to the subconscious and stored trauma.

Body: You’ll feel tingling, warmth, or lightness as your nervous system adjusts and releases.

Mind: A meditative, altered state. The Default Mode Network (the brain’s ego center) slows & calms down for the need to control various outcomes 

Soul: This is your gateway to deeper truths, energetic clearing, and direct downloads from the higher self.

——————

Final 30 Seconds: Double time breath + full-body squeeze + hold then release the breath and body at the same time to drop into a deep meditative state 

Science: Rapid breathing followed by a hold causes a neurochemical cocktail… dopamine, serotonin, and natural DMT like molecules surge. The muscle squeeze activates a full-body reset through neural tension release.

Body: The squeeze engages the pelvic floor and core, amplifying life force energy (kundalini), resetting the autonomic nervous system.

Mind: Your perception of time starts to slow down… Inner stillness expands. You’ve entered the theta state, the brainwave of healing and transformation. 

Soul: This moment is where many people feel oneness, clarity, peace, and breakthroughs.

Looking forward to meeting & connecting with everyone tomorrow 🙏🏼🌬️✨🕊️

Hey Anastasia and Jourdan,
Apologies for the double email, but wanted to check in before the long
weekend. Do you all use slack? It might speed things up to have a shared
channel to field questions in real time.

Thanks Spencer - the one link does not work.
- Please follow Checkmate Targeting Onboarding Instructions (AWIN)
Can you also please share steps for the Shopify app plugin so we can get
that installed?
I'll make sure my AWIN reps adjust your CPA next - although everyone is in
holiday mode right now so this will only get done on Monday!
Have a great long weekend!

Hi Anastasia and Jourdan,
Great to connect with you today! Excited to get this partnership launched
(and I can justify adding to my HigherDose collection)!
Following our call, I'm including a link to the deck we reviewed HERE
.
Next Steps:
- Please follow Checkmate Targeting Onboarding Instructions (AWIN)
- Once completed, we'll set the campaign amount to 10% off offer for
Checkmate Targeting.
I have our onboarding and customer success wizard, Shounak, copied here in
case there are any questions regarding onboarding.
Looking forward to working with you all!
All the best,

Hi Anastasia,
Strange that link isn't working -- please see the instructions for the
Shopify plug-in + AWIN attached and let me know if you have any troubles
accessing it or questions.
Hopefully we can get on board next week. I've gone ahead and asked the team
to reserve a push notification slot :)
Have a great long weekend!
All the best,
Spencer

Hi Anastasia,
Sharing a quick note. Kelly mentioned you might be a solid fit for what
we’ve been doing with brands like HOBO Bags and Little Beast.
Inspired reduces the need for deep discounting by using charitable
incentives (funded entirely by a network of major donors) that boost
checkout rates while protecting your profit margins. There’s no cost to you
or the shopper.
Try this instead of a 20% off: 15% to the shopper, 5% to a cause they care
about. That 5% donation keeps your margins safe.
Open to a short call to explore?

Stephen Ready

Hi Stephen
Saw that HigherDOSE is using Shopify – could be a fit for the same approach
we used with NOBULL, Florence by Mills, etc.
Anastasia Klaffert or Sumish Khadka is probably the right person for this:

Hey Anastasia!
My wife is a huge fan of HigherDOSE and after working with a few clients in
beauty she suggested (demanded) I reach out!
I run Good Day, a gaming-focused marketing agency that guides health &
beauty brands like Fenty Beauty, Dolce&Gabbana, and Starface into gaming,
helping them via strategy, licensing, promotions/collaborations, influencer
campaigns & events. With over 3 billion gamers worldwide - more than the
combined audiences of music and film - our brands find that gaming is one
of the most culturally powerful channels for brand discovery.
We would love to set up an intro call to chat through what we have done for
our existing clients in the space and learn how we can plug in with your
influencer team to get your products in the hands of gamers. We are
experienced in building out ambassador/creator programs, seeding/PR
initiatives, events and help identify the right creators for paid
opportunities.
I dropped our case study with Dolce&Gabbana below for reference.
Happy to make anytime work this week or next! Is this something you would
handle?
Best,
Tommy

Subject: New Wellness Shoppers For HigherDOSE Through Influencers
To: Anastasia Klaffert 
Hi Anastasia,
We’re rolling out a new wellness consumer portal in partnership with top
names like Jillian Michaels and Dr Peter McCullough. The portal offers
consumers free blood work, a virtual doctor visit, and tailored brand
suggestions based on their health needs. Shoppers also see what qualifies
for HSA or FSA reimbursement. As part of the launch, we’re featuring brands
like HigherDOSE that align with our mission.
All we need is a discount code (15% is standard) to include your product in
our ecosystem which is backed by media, email, and programmatic campaigns.
It’s free exposure to thousands of health-focused consumers
Interested in being featured? Feel free to book a call with me using my
Calendly link!
Cheers,
Jamie

installed.
Please see the forwarded message for the onboarding details (Shopify

Hi Anastasia,
Strange that link isn't working -- please see the instructions for the
Shopify plug-in + AWIN attached and let me know if you have any troubles
accessing it or questions.
Hopefully we can get on board next week. I've gone ahead and asked the team
to reserve a push notification slot :)
Have a great long weekend!
All the best,
Spencer

Google Ads June Performance // HigherDOSE

## Body

Hi Ingrid,
Hope you had a fantastic long weekend!
Since we are 7 days past the end of June, I wanted to send over a quick
Google Ads performance recap for the month:
June Performance Snapshot:
-
Conversion Value: $803,148.61
-
Cost: $123,362.33
-
ROAS: 6.51
-
ROAS by time: 6.98
Overall, June's performance looked great! We'll keep a close eye on
campaign-level performance as they adjust to their updated budgets this
month. Additionally, our upper-funnel YouTube campaigns will play a key
role in our success and expanding reach ahead of Q4.
Cheers,

Re: Google Ads June Performance // HigherDOSE

Thanks for sending this over Tori!
I'm glad we closed June strong and MTD performance for July is looking
promising with the increase in spend.
""ROAS by time"" is a new metric for me. Can you give context there?

Re: HigherDOSE x Twitch | Gaming Influencers

Yes this is interesting and I like the Dolce&Gabbana case study for a
visual on how they've partnered with other brands.
I'm open to a conversation and curious about your thoughts. I know Men
isn't a huge demographic for us but could help there also women do game so
could be an interesting partnership with some of our products.

Here’s how to find your best performing landing pages—and those that could use some changes—in Motion.

Hi Jourdan,
Here’s how to find your best performing landing pages in Motion:
Create a new top performing report → Group by “Landing page.”
Switch to card view (top right of chart) to get visuals of the actual landing pages. You can even click into the preview and scroll to see the full page. 🤯
I recommend adding these two metrics to drill down into the landing page side of things if you are focused on driving purchases:
- Click to ATC (Add to Cart) ratio
- Click to purchase
To find creatives that may benefit from changing the landing page…
Create a new top performing report → Group by “Ad name” or “Creative”
Filter for:
- Convert score below <70
- Click score above >70
- Set your spend threshold (i.e. spend above $100)
Then, +add metrics to your view → click score and convert score.
Scroll down to the data table and find your convert score → sort by lowest to highest.

Weekend sales strategies proved effective with a 53% increase in ROAS and a 42% decrease in CAC compared to weekdays. The Serotonin Soaked Salt product achieved a remarkable 6.3% click-to-purchase rate, outpacing Body Sculpt's 2.5%. The Body Sculpt campaign had a $1,300 spend, under $350 CAC, and a 2% click-through rate, exceeding account averages. After scaling on June 19, Google ads saw a notable increase in impressions and clicks, although conversions declined, indicating the need for strategic adjustments. The Demand Gen campaign launched on June 8 generated $13,494 in revenue from a $9,005 spend, and a TikTok strategy shift led to a promising 25 cost-per-click. Planning for July targets a 2.1 ROAS with a focus on Q4 preparation through creative testing. |  |  |  | | --- | --- | |  | Action Items |  | Jake Panzer   * Update customer lists for retention campaigns using CRM and Klaviyo access. * Switch Engage View attribution to standard seven-day click, one-day view for legacy campaigns. * Provide creative performance insights and recommendations for upcoming briefing calls. * Join Friday creative briefing calls at 9am PST starting next week. | | * Add Jake to bi-weekly creative briefing calls and coordinate pre-meeting check-ins. * Text Ingrid and Jordan about meeting attendance. | | * Schedule meeting with Google reps this week to discuss scaling performance and attribution discrepancies. * Create PMAX campaign dedicated to bundles with summer messaging. * Pull creative report for Demand Gen showing top and mid-funnel performance learnings. * Evaluate new search ad copy performance in 30 days and share results report. | | * Review July assumptions and sales goals with realistic efficiency targets. * Schedule awareness/top-of-funnel budget planning session for Monday with Ari and Jordan. * Coordinate with team on CTV campaign development and creative asset preparation. | | Ari Murray   * Participate in Monday session for experimental budget allocation planning. * Explore CTV platform options that can create commercials from existing assets. | | * Connect sidebar about July forecast adjustments. * Determine flash sale backup strategy for July targets. | | |

Re: MNTN | HigherDOSE - Recap

## Body

Hey Ingrid!
Happy to set up some time with you for when I'm back in office next week to
talk about the process of turning existing assets into a TV commercial.
It is however pretty straight forward on how to get started. We have our
self-service platform, QuickFrame Marketplace - which allows you to submit
a brief outlining the project details, and then connects you with our
network of video creators who you can choose from to complete your project.
I've attached a one-sheet with more info on the offering.
I'm able to apply credits to your account to make the project free of
charge. Let me know if you'd like to move forward with an account log in
for QuickFrame Marketplace and I can get that sent over with instructions
on how to submit a brief. Or feel free to snag some time using my calendar
link here

Agenda for Today's Call

## Body

Hey Tori,
Reaching out with today's agenda:
\*Scaling Test:\*
- Confirm next steps on the scaling test.
- Our POV is that we allow 30D in full (Jun 19 - Jul 18), then scale
down Pmax campaigns that aren’t driving incremental revenue.
\*Target ROAS Increase:\*
- We want to raise the target ROAS floor to 4–4.5.
- Can we make this change now? It’s important for us to be efficient
while pushing spend.
\*Demand Gen / YT Budget:\*
- If we scale to $500, how long do we realistically need to test for
accurate learnings?
- We also need to run a ToF YT campaign—how do we manage budget
allocation across both? Perhaps 70% to ToF and 30% to MoF?
Looking forward to our discussion today.
Best,
Rahul."

| Overall DTC spend increased 6.2% WoW while CAC improved by 2.2%, driving
a modest 2.7% lift in ROAS, with Google and Awin leading growth (Google
spend +11.7%, Awin spend +35.7%) and CAC efficiencies. Major wins include a
17% boost in Shopify sales, AWIN’s 35% spend growth with a 12% lower CAC,
and onboarding Prescient AI for improved measurement. Top areas to watch
are rising Meta CAC amid pulled-back budgets, underperforming TikTok and

Help Needed: CTV/OTT Creative Development

## Body

Hey team,
We are getting much more serious about our testing in the CTV channel and I
need your help in getting us ready with amazing and beautiful content.
Jourdan - will you please gather each of the potential partner's specs
(MNTN, YouTube, TVScientific) and put together a brief with Laura on
content needs.
Laura - please spend a little time combing through all our video content
(Sharma has done this too, I believe) and figure out what we have and what
we still need so I can plan shoots accordingly. I'd suggest pulling Margo
and/or Dani in to help as well.
Sharma - would love your involvement and guidance here given you've done
this before with other clients.
I'll leave you all here to connect, @Jourdan Smith
 please
be the ringleader of this workflow - I'd like to have a status chat
next week (Thursday?)
Thanks team!

Thanks for adding George Elyse!
Hey George,
Checking everyone's calendar it seems the following times work for most
people on the higher dose side for Friday 7/12.
9:15-10AM EST
2-4PM EST
However, the west coast members likely won't make the morning time slot.

Re: Decile X Higher Dose | Sync

Hi Jourdan,
Friday at 2pm EST works for me.
During our last call we discussed a few analysis that would be of interest
to the team
- Reviewing sequential purchase behavior
- Review mother's day sale
- Review new product launch
- Strategies for retention during the summer
Is there one of these topics that the team would like to focus on for our
call on Friday? Let me know and I can be sure to prepare relevant reports
for us to review.
Best,
George

Hey George,
Not sure how much value my response will be since I wasn't on the
previous call.
I assume we can't cover all 3 on one call but hitting the first 2 if
possible would be awesome.
Reviewing sequential purchase behavior - Will help us allocate the right
resources behind products that allow the business to grow.
Strategies for Retention during the summer - Summer has been a tough period
historically and bolstering retention channels can help with revenue
growth.
Review New Product Launch - Body Sculpt was a successful launch and I
selfishly want all the details.
Thank you,

Re: HigherDOSE

Hi team!
It was wonderful to reconnect today! We are so thrilled to have the
opportunity to potentially partner with HigherDose.
As promised, I'm following up with metrics we need to re-run the
partnership evaluation, next steps for onboarding (for reference) & lots of
valuable resources for tvScientific (include creative samples, specs,
inventory list, reporting demo & more.)
Please let us know if you have any additional questions! You're always
welcome to book a follow-up with me here: Morgan's Calendar
.
---
\*Partnership Evaluation: \*
\*\*Key Notes: Must be all channels combined (not only affiliate) & please
exclude Amazon traffic (or break out). Metrics should be for the brand
website only. If interested in Canada, please provide CA metrics separate
from US metrics. \*
- \*Metrics:\*
- Average monthly \*unique\* visits
- AOV
- Average monthly volume of orders/purchases
- \*Additional Details:\*\* Leave blank if unknown\*
- What is your standard affiliate offer (payable event & commission
rate?)
- Any other insights that would be helpful: budget, seasonality, target
audience, etc.
\*---\*
\*Onboarding Next Steps:\*
- \*Tracking Set-up:\*
- Please fill out this tech questionnaire
.

Hi Mati,
Thank you - is there a way to track those gifting instances separately in
the Bark AI so that we can get a more accurate read on CM? I track them in
my gifting tracker and we mark them specially in Shopify but we are ramping
up this effort so it would be good to adjust there as well. Let me know.
Best,
Ingrid

Have $0 orders been included in metrics this whole time?
If so, which?
They must be removed from bark as non existent

\*Description of Yesterday’s Issue:\*
In the last 7 days, \*51 Microcurrent Body Sculptor Ritual Sets\* , \*1 PEMF Pro Mat\* , and \*1 Red Light Face Mask\* were provided to creators through the \*ShopMy Cookbook program\* , which applies a \*100% discount\* at checkout.
Because these units were sent out free of charge, the system recorded \*$0 in Net Sales\* but still accounted for the associated costs (COGS, shipping, fulfillment). This resulted in a total \*negative Contribution Margin of ($8,749)\* , which effectively shows as costs.
In other words, this is expected behavior: the gifting activity is reflected as a cost without revenue, explaining the negative margins for these SKUs.

## Body

Hey Chris and Ingrid,
We already exclude the following:
\*
\*Draft Orders (and their returns):\*
We remove any sales that originated as Shopify Draft Orders. Accordingly, we also exclude any returns related to those excluded Draft Orders. In other words, if the original sale was excluded because it was a Draft Order, the corresponding return is also excluded.
\*
\*Specific line items:\*
We exclude line items in the following categories:
\*
Extend Service Contract
\*
Gift Card
\*
Gift
\*
Insurance
\*
Shipping Protection
Regarding ShopMy Cookbook program:
The discounts applied here reflect actual transactions. However, if preferred, we can also exclude them.
The P-OAS table without this discount key is shown below:

Hey Anastasia and Jourdan,
My name's Ronnie, and I lead the partnerships team at Checkmate. I wanted
to introduce myself directly in case you needed help with the onboarding
process.
It looks like you already downloaded the Checkmate Shopify app, and now you
just need to finalize the onboarding flow, which can be found here [LINK
].
There will be a status check at the end of the flow, confirming/denying if
you did everything correctly.
Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to hop on a call
with you to walk through it together.
Thanks, and looking forward to working with you!

let's also make sure we align to the new reporting style for these
structure shifts - we'll now need to see both the total
sales/spend/efficiency alongside product specific campaign health.

Added in Red Light Hat, we've got more Blanket and PEMF than red light
products. However Blanket and PEMF are down in sales MTD compared to last

get more resources here.
Laura Merrett
ok got it - SB is working on blanket creative from last time, but i also
added a few of our CPG's that are good for summer - are you aligned?

I believe the bundle images which are synced to GMC showcases the evergreen offer, and because of this, GMC has disapproved those SKUs as promotional imagery is not allowed in Google Shopping placements. Would you guys be able to provide <mailto:rahul@sharmabrands.com|rahul@sharmabrands.com> and <mailto:berkeley@sharmabrands.com|berkeley@sharmabrands.com> admin access to your GMC, and also provide us alternate image links for each bundle that's live on-site, which doesn't showcase the offer?

2025-07-10T17:22:00,slack,Jourdan,dm_with_Ingrid_4YDWBF,message,They also mentioned canvases that surround the video creative featuring quotes and QR codes
2025-07-10T17:23:00,slack,Jourdan,dm_with_Ingrid_4YDWBF,message,Liked that aspect because gives us the ability to incorporate messaging and give people option to visit website directly but after speaking with TV Scientific doesn’t seem that those are super effective
2025-07-10T17:23:00,slack,Jourdan,dm_with_Ingrid_4YDWBF,message,she mentioned 30s videos as being most successful on their placements so gives a little more time for QR codes but still not that much
2025-07-10T17:31:00,slack,Ingrid,dm_with_Ingrid_4YDWBF,message,"ok yea, i def think they are too expensive for us and I'd suggest we start with the other 2"

2025-07-10T17:45:00,slack,Jourdan,dm_with_Ingrid_4YDWBF,message,I’d give til end of day 3 to assess

2025-07-10T18:09:00,slack,Jourdan,dm_with_Ingrid_4YDWBF,message,"Surface level, I’m sure you see this too but CVR is down 52%, AOV down 13%, and Return customer down 10%  although sessions are up 132%.

This could improve Meta performance and drive more rev. However we need to improve Sauna Blanket and PEMF Mat paid media performance. Could be a creative solution or produce new landing page assets for those products."

2025-07-10T18:34:00,slack,Ingrid,dm_with_Ingrid_4YDWBF,message,She said you never go back to her?

2025-07-10T18:38:00,slack,Jourdan,dm_with_Ingrid_4YDWBF,message,however with sales being down we still need resources here to improve efficiency
2025-07-10T18:43:00,slack,Jourdan,dm_with_Laura_V28JJW,message,"Hey, apologies for the delayed response on your brief. For Red Light Neck Enhancer, did you pick that up from the call or were there other needs for creative there? I ask because Sauna Blanket &amp; PEMF mat are down in sales rev compared to last year and we want to push those but they’re not performing well w/ paid media. I’d like to get more creative in the mix there but if that’s gonna overload SB or delay their turn around i can push to next week :eyes:"
2025-07-10T18:46:00,slack,Laura,dm_with_Laura_V28JJW,message,"yes I thought jake said neck enhancer? or maybe I made that up lol, but I think we can maybe test the mask + neck enhancer together, and we also push them together too"

2025-07-10T18:47:00,slack,Jourdan,dm_with_Laura_V28JJW,message,Okay cool that could help with AOV because that’s taken a dip as well. I’m aligned with Mask + Neck Enhancer
2025-07-10T18:48:00,slack,Jourdan,dm_with_Laura_V28JJW,message,but yeah for sure red light hat that’s our winner

2025-07-10T18:54:00,slack,Laura,dm_with_Laura_V28JJW,message,i feel like it was more of a performance report? lol
2025-07-10T18:55:00,slack,Jourdan,dm_with_Laura_V28JJW,message,Lol yeah a bit confusing and they probably need more direction if this is the brief
2025-07-10T18:55:00,slack,Jourdan,dm_with_Laura_V28JJW,message,leaning in to what works organically might make the most sense
2025-07-10T18:55:00,slack,Jourdan,dm_with_Laura_V28JJW,message,Some of those videos move slow for ads though
2025-07-10T18:57:00,slack,Laura,dm_with_Laura_V28JJW,message,yeah

2025-07-10T18:58:00,slack,Jourdan,dm_with_Laura_V28JJW,message,Yeah all awareness and maybe core 4 to start?  I do like that you threw the Full Spectrum Sauna in the mix too.

2025-07-10T19:01:00,slack,Laura,dm_with_Laura_V28JJW,message,i think it would be cool to have the full size in there too but whatever you land on just lmk

2025-07-10T19:03:00,slack,Jourdan,dm_with_Ingrid_4YDWBF,message,Laura brought up Full Spectrum Sauna and mentioned Lauren has interest mixing topicals into our efforts  :eyes:
2025-07-10T19:04:00,slack,Jourdan,dm_with_Laura_V28JJW,message,Yeah definitely and get people started on that customer journey. Consideration cycle on Full spectrum sauna will be long so could be a good start for people to research the product
2025-07-10T19:04:00,slack,Laura,dm_with_Laura_V28JJW,message,yeah agree
2025-07-10T19:04:00,slack,Jourdan,dm_with_Laura_V28JJW,message,and i spoke with a CTV partner today and they had a case study with Laneige’s lip sleeping mask so seems like it can work with Low AOV products too
2025-07-10T19:04:00,slack,Laura,dm_with_Laura_V28JJW,message,i think we'd need to have other ads ready to go if we do launch with CTV
2025-07-10T19:04:00,slack,Laura,dm_with_Laura_V28JJW,message,oh nice
2025-07-10T19:05:00,slack,Jourdan,dm_with_Laura_V28JJW,message,Yeah deff will need to have full spectrum funnel and resources built out a bit to capitalize
2025-07-10T20:12:00,slack,Ingrid,dm_with_Ingrid_4YDWBF,message,"I’d start with lifestyle and core 4 to start, it’s a good intro to the brand "
2025-07-10T20:12:00,slack,Ingrid,dm_with_Ingrid_4YDWBF,message,Then we can add full size and topicals once we prove out the channel on the basics 
2025-07-10T20:13:00,slack,Jourdan,dm_with_Ingrid_4YDWBF,message,Okay sounds good
2025-07-10T20:13:00,slack,Jourdan,dm_with_Ingrid_4YDWBF,message,thank you
2025-07-10T20:13:00,slack,Jourdan,dm_with_Laura_V28JJW,message,Hey @Laura Ingrid said we should focus on more red light had and PEMF for tomorrow’s brief and for CTV start with lifestyle and core 4 then add full size and topicals when the channel becomes proven
2025-07-10T20:14:00,slack,Laura,dm_with_Laura_V28JJW,message,okay
2025-07-10T20:14:00,slack,Laura,dm_with_Laura_V28JJW,message,does she not want any of the other products?
2025-07-10T20:14:00,slack,Laura,dm_with_Laura_V28JJW,message,we should be getting more pemf by eow bc we briefed them last week
2025-07-10T20:17:00,slack,Jourdan,dm_with_Ingrid_4YDWBF,message,"Okay any interest in Endorphin oil + sweat band, trans mag spray, and press?  "
2025-07-10T20:18:00,slack,Laura,dm_with_Laura_V28JJW,message,if she is online we can also start a group slack lol
2025-07-10T20:21:00,slack,Jourdan,dm_with_Laura_V28JJW,message,"lol yeah group slack might be easiest to align us all. Although she did just respond so keep lets keep focus on Red Light Hat, Mask, PEMF, and SB for this week so we can get rev up. Then push Endorphin oil + sweat band, trans mag spray, and press to next week because she said they’re good entry points to the brand."

Re: GA4 Tracking Question

## Body

Hi Mike, thanks for clarifying the scopes—super helpful.
Looping in @Jourdan Smith  here, who leads our
performance marketing efforts on the HD side, so the Annatta team has a
direct point of contact as we work through this migration together.
I believe we’re all aligned that the Cardinal team is managing the live
site and current tag setup, while the Annatta team will handle the new
theme and tag configurations. Here’s how I see the next steps:
• \*Cardinal team:\* Verify that the current GA4 tag configuration is
tracking data accurately.
• \*Cardinal + Annatta:\* Work closely during the GA4 and other tag
migrations. For GA4 specifically, the Cardinal team will remove the
existing tags \*right before\* Annatta sets up the new configuration (using
the Google & YouTube Shopify app) to avoid any data loss during migration.
• \*Cardinal team:\* Provide a roadmap for migrating other tags to the new
site theme for Annatta’s review, then coordinate with Annatta for
implementation.
@Mike Hanley  Let us know if you see it
differently or can confirm alignment on these next steps.
@Jourdan Smith  Flagging you to help lead and
bridge between the Cardinal and Annatta teams during this process.
Best,
Rahul

Hi Ingrid, thanks for touching base! Just went ahead and cancelled the call
for today. We are finalizing a few concepts from this deck
she had sent over and we will have things ready for review on Monday's
call! We have our creative sync on the calendar for next Friday as well to
touch base on the next brief.
Please let us know if you need anything in the meantime, thanks Ingrid!

Re: Weekly Updates 7/11 | Sharma x HD

## Body

Thank you for the summary!
HD team, just fyi since we just made all the major structural changes in
Meta, this softer week is expected. We intentionally did it during Prime
“Day” (week) since we knew results would be mixed this week regardless.
We are checking in on performance daily and also uncovering a ton more
information about our product demand in this new structure so it’s a win
for that alone - then the sales will follow the optimization.
Thanks and have a great weekend.

| |  | | --- | | Hi Seller! | | We have updated our Product Listing Policy to include a new product listing behavior that is prohibited. This addition is meant to protect the customer experience and help your shop continue to build customer trust. | | **Misleading product listings:***Sellers are strictly prohibited from repurposing existing product listings**to represent a different product**, also known as ""bait and switch""**.**This includes using an existing listing but changing key details such as the title, images, brand, or price in a way that misleads customers and invalidates previous reviews or**delivery* *data**.* | | **Best Practices for Product Listings** | | * Ensure all listing content, including titles, images, and descriptions, accurately reflects the product’s appearance, functionality, and effect. * Create a new listing when introducing a different version of a product, such as a redesign or updated model, so that reviews, ratings, and order data reflect the correct item. * Make only minor changes, such as updating images, price, description, or SKU, if the product itself remains the same. These changes should still reflect the exact product being sold. * Avoid   making major edits that change the product being sold, such as switching the image, title, brand, or price in a way that misrepresents the original product. | | The violation of this new policy can result in enforcement actions being taken. For more information, refer to our **[Product Listing Policy.](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ8JZNozXXQE)** | | To learn more about best practices, please refer to our **[Product Listing: What You Need to Know](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ8JZNozoaSl)**article. | | Be sure to regularly check **[TikTok Shop Academy](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ8JZNp05dUX)** to stay informed and follow the **[@TikTokShopAcademy](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ8JZNp0MgWZ)** channel for tips and tricks on staying up to date. | |

NCROAS: 0.22x (-36% WoW) 🟡
59% New Visits: -1% 🟡
CAC: $1169 (+55% WoW) 🔴
-
Although this week performance has taken a downturn, this is to be
expected with the amount of changes made this week as we implemented the
new structure below:
-
Sauna Blanket CBO
-
PEMF Mat CBO
-
Red Light Mask CBO
-
Red Light Hat CBO
-
Body Care + Supplements ABO
-
The final portion of the new setup is a Bundle Specific campaign, which
we’ll be standing up early next week as we cycle in new creatives and
carousels
-
One of the most important KPIs we’ll be tracking with the new setup is %
New Visits, and adjusting audience exclusions accordingly
-
We’re continuing to troubleshoot the catalog issues and will have them
resolved shortly

\*Note: Revenue, CAC, and ROAS will improve over time after late attribution
is accounted for. YoY numbers are unavailable since Northbeam was set up
for Google late last year. Some scaled Pmax campaigns seem to be responding
well, WoW. We can continue to ramp them up at the 30D mark.

Please see [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i0FND-8p7CjiRzOjRk0AFC7nRfWXxWwSbYZHzLhYf1A/edit?usp=sharing) for our Tiktok relationship to the other channels and business as a whole. Happy to pull anymore numbers and explain this further anytime. Definitely some interesting insights here! We are prepared to take action on turning off the SPC and launching a red light mask specific funnel, but decided to hold for feedback. Let us know what you think. Thank you and have a great weekend!

You need a translator — someone who can turn your ad performance data into tangible insights your creative team can implement.

Hey Jourdan,
In the last email, we discussed how creatives are the new ad targeting.
And if that’s true — you need to acknowledge something fundamental: your media performance is entirely dependent on creative. Your designers and UGC creators are closer to the revenue function than they’ve ever been.
And you might be surprised to know that the creators on your team want detailed feedback on what’s working and what isn’t.
But they need to receive that feedback in a language they can understand.
What they aren’t going to understand: your media buying spreadsheets.
You live in Ads Manager and Excel, they live in Adobe and Figma. It’s classic right brain vs left brain, creative vs analytical.
That’s why you need a translator. A way to connect the data to the content.
Part of this is a process problem, but part of it is a people problem too.
On the process side, your applicant pool is the same folks I touched on in my last email (https://content.motionapp.com/e3t/Ctc/GF+113/d2hYgB04/VW44B86\_BW-xVTFc-q8RTjGlW2nfwL35yXddjN4Tr4M65m\_5PW50kH\_H6lZ3kKW2Ng0Vz5mNFgSW5Hrs-s59YHLXN6CMCHNHtpCnW3dmfzv7GwfJ0W85\_FT35xjH6DW3jTJcn6x9cyfN6VVC0pc27zHW4MMQPk7r2hvjW58Jvng6z6WS-W3RH5C76Y2vrTW8QfpDf350NK2VJN5jc1Q\_ZscW4rYWkk8ZpVfrW570VhD4-5jGRW85GfHZ2r5r9dW6S2Z5S4JW0Q-W38lTY459TR8CW7LY\_zz4Ys9dLW67Zwvy5SZBbcW8tSGnf2rkGb6VwlGLP8gLD77W4JwdsX4ZBZ9qVpqxGQ4gvyHmW1M1zhR6g\_shnW1-\_Rs85mVbP0VwLtnS34f\_LtN71Jc4wD-vz9N3XVyycJ690FW7P8G-W6444N1W1f-2BP143BmkW5ZWCGq559yF-W6JXM8T8B0lmlf3zVp1T04 ) :
- Ads Manager
- Spreadsheets
- Motion
On the people side, here is your applicant pool:
- A data-minded creative: A designer who wants to understand the “why” behind their design by digging into the data
- A creative-minded marketer: A marketer who wants to take their creative analysis one step further by kickstarting the creative ideation process
- A creative strategist: A person who lives between the creative team and media buyers and exists to answer two questions: “What do we do next, and how do we do it?”
But here’s the secret — in filling the need for a “translator,” all of these people are acting as a creative strategist.
In 10 days, I’ll tell you why this has become the fastest-growing job in performance marketing and share some stories from some of the top creative strategists out there. Or, if you want to get the content sooner - send a quick reply and I'll put you in our express track.

support getting HigherDose's commercial activated smoothly & swiftly.

I have sent a request to connect to both Google & FB accounts. Once those
are accepted I will be able to proceed with the rest of the connection

Yes can you please go into each platform and accept the requests.
In Meta it should be under your requests tab
In Google: Navigate to Tools & Settings -> Access and Security -> Managers
and you should see a pending request.
Let me know if you run into any issues!
Best,
George

Re: HigherDOSE

Hi Anastasia & team,
Well, we had \*quite\* the eventful end to the week, which brings me to some
exciting news for HigherDose..
I'm thrilled to share that \*we’ve eliminated the evaluation process & we
can now partner with any brand on a CPA rate\*. No more asking for metrics
or meeting pre-qualification steps!
After 3.5 years of building CTV on a performance model, our founders and
leadership team are all-in. They're extremely confident in our product,
media team, and inventory partnerships - and now we’re ready to partner
with all brands on a CPA or CPL model.
In addition to sharing this news, please find a quick (updated) overview of
our opportunity below, along with our recommendations for this new approach
& onboarding next steps.
- High-level Overview of tvScientific CTV-Affiliate Opportunity
If you're ready to move forward with onboarding to test with tvScientific,
please share your CPA rate details!
Cheers!
Morgan

Hi Morgan,
Amazing! I was just about to email you our numbers. Appreciate the update!
Let me know if those metrics are still needed at this stage; otherwise,
we’re ready and excited to get this test up and running.
Our standard AWIN commission rate is 10%, and Kylie can ensure everything
is set up correctly from a tracking and tagging standpoint. Happy to
fine-tune as we go.
Working on content as I type, excited to get this launched!
Best,
Anastasia

Hi Anastasia,
Very excited to build a relationship with tvscientific! The highlighted section below means that you do not need to complete the tech questions below if you would like to move forward with Awin’s Mastertag. Typically, implementing with the Mastertag is the easiest way to integrate.

Hey Ingrid,
Gearing up for the rest of July's onboardings and have HigherDose on the

can help with, just let me know.
Apologies for the persistent follow-up, seeing a lot of demand pre-BFCM and
want to ensure our engineering/CS team is properly allocated.

Steal the all in ONE creative report I keep coming back to

## Body

Find winners, hypothesize performance & deep dive video insights. All in ONE report.
I can't gatekeep any longer. I've been using this view for the last 2 months and it has changed my creative analysis game because I can...
- See what's working
- Quickly understand WHY
- And even deep dive into video metrics + demographics
....All in ONE report. No wonder I can't stay away from it 🙈
My most used report view (https://content.motionapp.com/e3t/Ctc/GF+113/d2hYgB04/VWYFMN2p1YY4W4rPPB-2zvJQ3W5yX2x95y-RvVN7KkK0T5m\_5PW5BWr2F6lZ3lpW4Hl9KX3Fh11nW4hBxz693TdwbW4C9KtR8lpG6SW9kKvFT56kThvVYmnwp7hgtTZW7fcqnz32JX42W73GfcX67zT9rW7MKgFy1Yx5x0W7nD-h\_42KBp4W2Bdgl6757QtvN5kjVNqZbk4WW8KG82R5BhLrJW2ZmNZB1f0zbkW1R8SLj8ZcR52W6q8p6g6\_ZRmCW5CDqqh6t8nzNV\_WyLw6fCncBN2fm3zhHcxrVW94sVdq1Zq\_CJV9l-726B2rn3W8bZtgj4LXhpzW9dNcWl3P9whfW3qxZ3g3743sWW9l3-4l8sQtJ\_MxxdxQqdqhTW2DpldT21gFCNW8tj1ds7YmC7bW1bcRF35YR5qmW7d9fGB1z75B7W3xtdsG3djpv9W3r-6nv5Rg3M7W3d0FnZ45s2gNW4Y1QVL55jG79W2dj8V360dnpFf3W57BF04 )

Thank you, Mati.
I think it's a good time to have a touch base call with Jourdan, Sharma and
me so that we can explain our new Meta setup and how we are adjusting
things (just went into place last week). This will create a slight
instability in the account short term but long term will give us much more
opportunity to fine tune our creative and investments. Would love your
input and awareness here.
@Jourdan Smith  and @Berkeley Clark
 will you please help find some time to have
this chat? Ideally we do it this week, but I'm out Friday. Only need 30
min.
Thanks!
Ingrid

Yesterday ( Sunday ) saw a major drop in sales—the lowest in the last 30 days. We don’t know if this was due to a website, operational, or other significant issue.
\*2. Special Tracker – Amazon Prime Monitor\*
3. \*Exposure Optimization Strategy\*
I suggest we set up a meeting to:
\*
Explore ways to promote additional products and bundles beside relying heavily on the Red Light Hat.
\*
Address the GA4 tracking issue: views for the Sauna Blanket are being collected incorrectly (possibly due to multiple SKUs) and are excluded from the above reporting. We need to resolve this GA4 problem as soon as possible.

Everything ok?

## Body

Hey Jourdan,
Just wanted to check in—hope everything’s okay on your end. You missed the
Sharma call this morning, which is a key part of your role, so I wanted to
make sure you’re alright and see what happened.
I also haven’t seen the executive summary yet with the key takeaways and
action items from this week and last—can you send that over when you get a
chance?
I know we move fast and expectations are high, so if anything feels off or
if you’re finding it hard to keep pace, let’s talk. I want to make sure you
have what you need to be successful here.
Best,
Ingrid

Total sales reached $266K, exceeding the revised goal of $190K by 11.5%, with expenditures totaling $74.6K across various platforms. The Meta account is transitioning to product-specific campaigns, with a noted recovery in the Dr. Cabral campaign achieving a 1.1 one-day click ROAS. Applovin's Average Order Value (AOV) increased 36% week-over-week to $554, indicating a need for targeted strategies for older demographics. Google PMAX scaling has begun, increasing spend by 50%, resulting in a 20% growth in impressions but no conversion improvements yet.

Hi Anastasia,
It's a pleasure to meet you! I'm looking forward to working with you
throughout the onboarding process for HigherDOSE.
Thanks for submitting the tech questionnaire – we've received your
responses and will be following up with your custom tech plan shortly.
I also wanted to outline the next steps for Awin below:
- Please push the \*10% CPA terms to tvScientific (1134907)\* so we can
batch our performance data.
- Also, please send over the signee details for our custom CPA terms
(attached), which we'll send over via Docusign. We'll just need the
following signee details:
- Full name
- Title
- Email address
If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're
excited to launch HigherDOSE soon!
Best,
Erika

Hey Chris,
Let me know once you've added use and I can get the account hooked up.
Additionally, can you please reconnect your Klaviyo connection here
.
This will put your account on the latest version of the API.
Thanks,
George

Re: Everything ok?

Hey Ingrid,
Yes ma'am thank you for asking and I'm back online. We're getting her to
the Ortho this afternoon. I'll have the complete executive summary
over to you soon and have everything I need to be successful in this role.
I'm working on an automation that will help me compile the data and updates
a lot faster just running into errors with formatting this much data in a
Google Doc.
It's all based on North Beam data and I was able to break out performance
by product based on keywords in campaign, ad set, and ad names but there's
some ads with missing data which I included a table of further down.
My sincere apologies for missing the Sharma call yesterday and will
communicate proactively if I'm not able to make meetings in the future so
we can adjust if necessary.

Hi Ingrid, all,
Great meeting you, Yoav speaks very highly of you guys so excited to kick this off.
Could we start with a quick intro session? We always love to first hear a bit more about the business and current priorities / challenges and then dive into work. Context is very helpful for us to align better with your team.
Where are you guys located?
FYI – although the full team is on the thread, it would be me and Noam who will work with you.
Thanks,

Hi Ingrid, all,
Great meeting you, Yoav speaks very highly of you guys so excited to kick this off.
Could we start with a quick intro session? We always love to first hear a bit more about the business and current priorities / challenges and then dive into work. Context is very helpful for us to align better with your team.
Where are you guys located?
FYI – although the full team is on the thread, it would be me and Noam who will work with you.

Hey Omer, morning times may be a bit difficult. Ingrid is OOO Monday and
Tuesday and her morning are a little full for next week. Safe to assume
she’ll want to be on the first call with you all.
Ingrid, do you have flexibility for a morning CST/EST call next week?

Hi Anastasia,
Thanks so much for sending of these details!
Confirming the Docusign document has been sent to Lauren. Also, when checking the CPA terms in Awin, we noticed that there are multiple commission terms listed in the network. Would you be able to update the terms so that the 10% commission is listed across the board?
Looking forward to hearing from you!
