WEBVTT

00:00.469 --> 00:06.010
Okay, so this is the process for actually creating a repo, and I'm going to try and do this part from scratch.

00:06.330 --> 00:09.691
I may run into an issue with the 2FA, I think, and I just thought about it.

00:10.231 --> 00:28.195
But basically, I have this new repo repository that I've created for easily creating new repos, and I'm going to run Python and say repo underscore new, because that's the Python script I want to run, and then I'll ask Jordan questions on this.

00:28.215 --> 00:28.815
I want to put it

00:29.435 --> 00:32.917
It says enter the local parent folder for the repo code.

00:33.097 --> 00:34.178
This is going to be research.

00:35.239 --> 00:38.841
Instead of a tool, add the name of the repo.

00:38.901 --> 00:43.604
So what's the name of the company you're going to be working with?

00:43.664 --> 00:44.465
Higher Dose.

00:44.485 --> 00:45.665
H-I-G-H-E-R-D-O-S-E.

00:45.685 --> 00:46.546
Okay.

00:47.307 --> 00:49.488
And hire all of them.

00:49.728 --> 00:50.569
All one word.

00:51.589 --> 00:52.590
Dose is capitalized.

00:55.228 --> 00:56.372
Oh, D-O-S-E, okay.

00:56.995 --> 01:00.228
It doesn't matter, but I'm going to capitalize it that way just because.

01:12.742 --> 01:14.162
Okay, I'm going to leave it.

01:14.203 --> 01:16.763
So I have a bunch of defaults here in this script as I'm running it.

01:16.803 --> 01:19.084
So if you see here in gray, it says default.

01:19.684 --> 01:20.465
I'm just going to hit enter.

01:21.345 --> 01:23.286
Is this repo for an organization or a user?

01:23.366 --> 01:30.568
Right now it's a user, but like you could technically create a new org per project or a new org to house all of these projects.

01:30.668 --> 01:32.369
I just keep it at the user level if it's simple.

01:32.769 --> 01:35.010
And then I'll create orgs as things get a little bit more complicated.

01:35.070 --> 01:36.150
In this case, I'm just going to go user.

01:36.170 --> 01:37.130
I'm going to leave it private.

01:37.411 --> 01:38.451
That's the default right now.

01:38.931 --> 01:43.092
Public means like all the code that you commit will get seen by other people and picked up by bots eventually.

01:45.613 --> 01:57.136
In your case, it would be OU codes, but I don't have access to your 2FA thing, so I'm just going to put in, in this case, ChrisGHCodes, which is a username I set up specifically for this.

01:57.877 --> 02:05.479
Same thing for my git name, because this is just every time I make a commit and I hit that git log that I showed you earlier, this is the username that will be associated with that.

02:06.019 --> 02:09.663
And then same thing, this is the email that will be associated with the commits.

02:09.823 --> 02:16.631
This is important to know because if you ever make this repo public or try and share the code, this username and email will be shared with whoever it is.

02:16.731 --> 02:20.354
So if you have like alts that you want to make stuff under, just be mindful as you're making these repos.

02:20.655 --> 02:24.118
That stuff can be changed later, so it's not a huge deal, but it helps to know.

02:25.819 --> 02:29.622
Okay, now I have to open the browser associated with this.

02:30.042 --> 02:34.705
So I'm going to actually close this one, open this one, go to GitHub.

02:34.725 --> 02:35.626
I may or may not be signed in.

02:35.686 --> 02:36.366
I am signed in.

02:36.727 --> 02:38.828
So I go back and hit enter to continue.

02:39.409 --> 02:47.274
It runs in the background a couple of cool things that basically set up a repo for you, make sure you're logged in, so on and so forth.

02:47.294 --> 02:51.217
I should be logging out, but I'm not.

02:53.163 --> 02:53.503
Oh, I did.

02:53.543 --> 02:53.763
Okay.

02:53.803 --> 02:55.124
I changed the functionality to some of that.

02:55.144 --> 02:55.544
Okay.

02:55.744 --> 02:57.305
So that being said.

02:57.325 --> 03:04.588
Okay.

03:04.749 --> 03:06.289
I mean, the one I want is at the top.

03:06.309 --> 03:06.990
So I'm going to go here.

03:07.010 --> 03:07.570
Oh, whoops.

03:08.911 --> 03:14.393
It says open the, press enter to open that link in the browser.

03:14.453 --> 03:16.574
It just needs to be the relevant browser that you want it to be.

03:16.754 --> 03:19.936
I'm actually going to move it over to the first desktop just in case, because I don't want no smoke.

03:22.714 --> 03:23.354
Then hit enter.

03:24.174 --> 03:24.995
It opens this link.

03:25.075 --> 03:25.955
I have to hit continue.

03:26.755 --> 03:28.516
Paste in the code that was from the CLI.

03:28.536 --> 03:30.616
Hit authorize GitHub.

03:30.696 --> 03:32.677
And this is where it asked me for my 2FA.

03:32.697 --> 03:35.998
And nice.

03:36.418 --> 03:36.718
Okay.

03:36.978 --> 03:38.159
It looks like I won't have issues.

03:39.419 --> 03:39.899
Okay, good.

03:40.620 --> 03:42.460
So that does what it needs to do.

03:42.580 --> 03:43.961
And then I can go back to the

03:46.923 --> 03:49.585
Please transcribe in clear, punctuated English, preserving speaker turns.

04:03.246 --> 04:04.907
It now is creating everything automatically.

04:04.927 --> 04:05.968
I don't have to touch anything else.

04:06.048 --> 04:12.834
What that did was create a repository in the cloud on github.com, as well as on my local computer under whatever folder I told it to make.

04:13.194 --> 04:21.041
So in this case, I can go to code, research, and I should be able to type in HI for higher dose and then autocomplete it.

04:21.241 --> 04:22.202
And now we're in the repo.

04:22.943 --> 04:26.946
And the only thing there is a README file, which is automatically created by default.

04:27.567 --> 04:30.809
This is like the basis for the repo that we kind of like need.

04:33.051 --> 04:37.855
So now pretty much begins the questions.

04:38.015 --> 04:42.619
So I go over to Cursor or VS Code or whatever IDE you're using at the moment.

04:43.060 --> 04:47.103
Again, I think Cursor is probably the best one for the value, but there's lots of other options out there.

04:47.123 --> 04:49.845
So you don't necessarily need to be confined to Cursor.

04:50.186 --> 04:51.106
It's just kind of like what I know.

04:51.587 --> 04:57.952
And I'm going to hit open, go over to my code folder, back to research where you were, and then go to higher dose.

04:58.212 --> 04:59.714
Once I've selected higher dose, I can hit open.

05:01.698 --> 05:04.320
And this is where the real work kind of starts to get interesting.

05:04.600 --> 05:10.724
So the first thing I would probably do is put together a list of questions.

05:12.345 --> 05:14.226
The README oftentimes comes much later.

05:14.246 --> 05:17.148
I don't worry about filling in the README until quite a bit of context is here.

05:17.248 --> 05:20.270
And then you just ask the model to create the README and it does a great job at it.

05:20.770 --> 05:27.755
But in this case, I think I'm gonna do todo.md to create a to-do list and then a notes folder.

05:30.914 --> 05:42.681
And oftentimes what I also put in here as kind of like a meta way to keep up with the conversations that I've had over here with the chat bot, I'll create a context.md to kind of get things started.

05:42.701 --> 05:44.722
It's just like a priming what we want.

05:45.663 --> 05:49.385
So here I'm just going to put

05:53.092 --> 05:53.813
Context.

05:54.233 --> 05:57.055
And then so the header is context in Markdown.

05:57.075 --> 06:01.638
So I put a hashtag space context and I put a double hashtag to say questions.

06:02.199 --> 06:02.619
So like.

06:08.143 --> 06:08.603
And actually.

06:11.746 --> 06:15.388
Let's start here because I have questions to ask you before we get to the questions you want to ask the repo.

06:15.568 --> 06:17.250
So I don't get out of order.

06:18.130 --> 06:19.671
What does higher dose do in your words?

06:23.732 --> 06:26.794
They sell health and wellness electronic devices.

06:28.675 --> 06:29.615
Sells health.

06:30.616 --> 06:33.438
Along with, like, beauty topicals.

06:34.338 --> 06:42.763
And then, you know, electronic devices in beauty and supplement space.

06:47.086 --> 06:47.326
Nice.

06:47.666 --> 06:51.108
Okay, so that already gives me a great idea of, like, what this is going to be about.

06:54.827 --> 06:59.992
What was the last task that your higher-up asked you?

07:00.032 --> 07:10.002
Simo asked for a one-pager report on the first half of the year's performance and comparing it to last year.

07:13.125 --> 07:14.667
So previous year for the same six months.

07:24.517 --> 07:24.857
Okay.

07:26.038 --> 07:29.400
And so that was a task that you asked me to do.

07:29.420 --> 07:29.661
Okay.

07:33.523 --> 07:36.325
On a day-to-day basis, how often do you get to touch the ads?

07:36.966 --> 07:39.047
I'm not touching the ads at all.

07:39.147 --> 07:49.915
I'm communicating with the agency that manages the ads or the vendors that manage our ads across various channels.

07:49.935 --> 07:51.836
Okay.

07:51.876 --> 07:53.858
Communicating with the agency that touches the ads.

07:57.346 --> 07:57.706
Okay.

08:00.428 --> 08:00.808
Okay.

08:01.549 --> 08:09.294
Okay, okay, okay.

08:09.354 --> 08:19.740
And then... For the onboarding, who on the team did they have you meet?

08:19.760 --> 08:21.501
I mean...

08:27.878 --> 08:35.540
I had to meet the agencies I met or internal team members that I would be working with.

08:37.740 --> 08:43.162
Or just like vendors to explain agencies, internal team members.

08:44.502 --> 08:50.083
And I had already met higher levels of the team through the interview process.

08:50.884 --> 08:53.004
So I didn't necessarily have to meet with them again.

08:53.544 --> 08:56.845
But there is one, like he's the, I wouldn't call him like the CFO.

08:57.987 --> 09:02.670
But he oversees a lot of the tech, finance.

09:03.471 --> 09:07.954
He's kind of like a multi-hat kind of guy, HR stuff.

09:09.575 --> 09:11.677
So I deal with him fairly often, but...

09:25.250 --> 09:25.610
Okay.

09:26.411 --> 09:29.272
That's funny that it was able to hear your voice in there.

09:31.754 --> 09:35.416
Um, yeah, the built-in is like, it's like lightweight decent.

09:35.456 --> 09:37.597
I was thinking about building a tool around that, but it's not worth it.

09:37.997 --> 09:38.597
Um, okay.

09:39.098 --> 09:41.499
That's, that's a decent context, at least for initially.

09:41.919 --> 09:47.302
And then what I'm going to do is actually to give it, feed it this transcript and ask it to ground the context based on what you actually said.

09:47.522 --> 09:48.543
Cause I missed some stuff.

09:48.583 --> 09:51.785
I misspelled some stuff on purpose and.

09:54.887 --> 09:58.029
On a day-to-day basis, what are you trying to automate when dealing with higher dose?

09:58.069 --> 10:00.431
What actually matters to you the most?

10:01.071 --> 10:04.433
Compiling the reports and building it.

10:04.453 --> 10:23.466
A lot of it is replying to vendors and email threads and communicating with the agency to stay on top of the deliverables and action items that they have in order for me to contextualize what's going on on these channels.

10:24.141 --> 10:26.925
To the CMO who then communicates it to the rest of the team.

10:27.666 --> 10:38.500
So I guess to interrupt you, like it's somewhat like the middle, like you're playing the middleman that gets on your nerves when you're working with other

10:39.868 --> 10:44.513
Yeah, I'm pretty much an account manager for the agencies that communicate to the CMO what's going on.

10:44.953 --> 10:48.837
But it's my job to interpret the data in a way that I can cleanly communicate.

10:48.877 --> 10:57.065
She's just trying to eliminate the amount of contact she has to have with the outside vendors by placing me as the middle ground.

10:57.465 --> 10:58.847
But I'm also supposed to be...

11:00.268 --> 11:06.875
Like budgeting, forecasting, planning for our, she's got, here's our higher initiatives.

11:06.895 --> 11:07.956
This is what we want to spend.

11:07.976 --> 11:09.598
This is the efficiency I want.

11:09.618 --> 11:15.985
It's up to you to determine which channels these go on at what performance metrics.

11:16.545 --> 11:17.746
Thank you for watching.

11:43.659 --> 11:45.260
But that's where I'm an interim.

11:45.320 --> 11:47.861
It's like, okay, we gave them these goals.

11:48.582 --> 11:58.947
Based on what we're seeing, it's not possible with this channel mix or this budget mix on these channels, so we need to realign, readjust, and go at different channels and scale different ones.

11:58.987 --> 12:00.347
That's kind of what we're doing now.

12:00.587 --> 12:05.250
Facebook is shit, so we're shifting more spend to Google because it's outperforming and scaling well.

12:06.450 --> 12:11.673
But it's my decision to make those calls and to have the insight

12:13.154 --> 12:16.305
To understand, like, okay, obviously just brute force in Facebook isn't

12:18.464 --> 12:20.165
Make our advertising more efficient.

12:20.185 --> 12:24.989
So until we can get that dialed in, we have to allocate resources elsewhere.

12:25.109 --> 12:30.353
But it's also up to me to get the right resources on Meta to bring CAC down.

12:30.413 --> 12:34.035
So it's like pushing our creative strategies.

12:34.215 --> 12:37.878
When you say get the right resources to bring CAC down, what are the resources?

12:37.898 --> 12:43.002
So like getting the creative strategies to produce more assets for our core products.

12:43.402 --> 12:46.645
You just like chase them, like, hey, we need you to do your job, basically.

12:46.745 --> 12:55.994
It's like chasing other people to get and focus on the right products that are going to drive the revenue of the efficiencies we need.

12:56.495 --> 12:57.155
So, okay.

12:57.476 --> 12:58.937
It's like being a fucking go-ahead.

12:59.217 --> 13:00.459
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:01.119 --> 13:02.080
No, people get paid for that.

13:02.120 --> 13:03.321
That's what blows my mind.

13:03.341 --> 13:07.045
There's a lot of people in this growth role, and it's always anywhere from $130 to $200.

13:08.546 --> 13:12.347
That's insane.

13:12.707 --> 13:17.208
Either you have vendors, like agencies handling it, or you have in-house teams that you're managing.

13:17.248 --> 13:26.490
So either way, you're goat-hurrying people to execute on these channels and to make sure that they're achieving the KPIs necessary.

13:26.510 --> 13:29.630
But I'm more technical, whereas the CMO is high-level.

13:30.091 --> 13:31.911
Here's the overall initiatives that we want.

13:31.951 --> 13:36.812
The products we want to release, they're more so strategy in that direction, like product development,

13:39.648 --> 13:41.109
How do we hit our overall goals?

13:41.150 --> 13:46.394
The founders and leaders like, hey, we want to do 30 or 60 million this year.

13:46.775 --> 13:49.858
And it's up to the CMO, like, okay, how do we achieve 60 million?

13:49.878 --> 13:50.598
What's possible?

13:51.179 --> 13:53.001
She's in that, like playing in that space.

13:53.541 --> 13:56.084
And then it's like, okay, we need to do 60 million.

13:56.144 --> 13:57.945
How do you do it from a technical standpoint?

13:57.965 --> 13:59.547
I see channels we're advertising on.

13:59.867 --> 14:04.491
That's where the growth guide comes in, and it's like, okay, we need to push these levers here, here, there.

14:04.511 --> 14:13.618
I'm more technical in my understanding of how each of these channels work, what's possible, what CAC targets do we need to hit in order to back out to 60 million at the efficiency we need.

14:14.659 --> 14:22.405
Yeah, so I do... One thing I have not focused on, as I did the last tutorial, part one, and then this tutorial, part two, is straight up...

14:25.520 --> 14:33.542
For lack of a better word, you're building a kind of like a manual in-text CRM, because I have not really focused on the people aspect of it.

14:33.602 --> 14:38.484
But for the last two classes that I took, actually the first class, that was a huge deal.

14:39.844 --> 14:41.024
And I think I have those notes here.

14:41.084 --> 14:41.865
I should be able to pull them up.

14:42.165 --> 14:46.726
That was a huge deal, like having literally a glossary of the people involved in this particular project.

14:46.986 --> 14:49.227
So it makes it easier to, I can say by one name.

14:49.447 --> 14:49.747
So like,

14:50.507 --> 14:56.612
In the chat assistant, I can say like, yo, Joe told me this or that, and they know exactly who Joe is, what he does, what his role is.

14:57.233 --> 14:58.674
Stuff like that is actually important.

14:59.115 --> 14:59.935
I'll stop the timer.

15:00.095 --> 15:00.736
Dang, we're out of time.

15:01.036 --> 15:02.397
Yeah, stuff like that is actually important.

15:02.618 --> 15:11.765
I would say that... As someone who knows a fair bit of open source software, it does kind of like...

15:12.856 --> 15:18.463
Inspire me to look into the... Because there's two CRMs that I think are open source and would be useful.

15:18.844 --> 15:22.128
But I see now how these two things can go hand in hand.

15:22.168 --> 15:25.092
Having an agent that can have access to a CRM that at the very...

15:54.322 --> 16:02.026
Simply knowing the relationships between the people and who to, like she asked you a question like, hey, this is an initiative we want to push for the next two weeks.

16:02.406 --> 16:07.388
So you type this into something like the chat bot and it literally pulls up a list of the people that you should be contacting and sending it.

16:07.728 --> 16:09.989
And then what I would go, I would take it a step further.

16:10.089 --> 16:12.950
Okay, give me an example of an email I should send this person.

16:13.331 --> 16:14.091
And then go down the list.

16:14.111 --> 16:18.733
Like if I got three or four people that you're saying I should contact, what should I be saying to them to like get them to do their job?

16:19.093 --> 16:21.114
So again, all that context is super helpful in this case.

16:21.334 --> 16:25.236
This transcript is going to be great because it already kind of gave you a snapshot of where you're at right now.

16:25.556 --> 16:27.858
And of course, it'll come with a timestamp and all that good stuff.

16:28.258 --> 16:33.001
But that's what I think the real value in having a repository like this is about.

16:33.101 --> 16:36.963
It's not only the relationship management, but having the context of like,

16:37.603 --> 16:40.106
What they want and what you're supposed to do.

16:40.206 --> 16:53.901
And what I'm hoping is, like, whatever model is doing this transcription or doing this summarizing is able to, like, maybe give us some ideas and some, like, next steps on, like, what we should do to maybe better organize or what Jordan should do to better organize this.

16:54.761 --> 17:01.165
And it'd be easy if the CRM could just tap into Slack, because a lot of the details are in Slack about people's roles, their emails, who they are.

17:01.185 --> 17:07.928
And then, like, even if you just API the data out of Slack for all these conversations, for it to have the context, that would be amazing.

17:08.108 --> 17:16.413
Yeah, I think that's... One thing, I mean, I love Discord because it's, like, so much of a gamer's platform and it's, like, easy to connect with other people.

17:17.674 --> 17:17.914
On the...

17:20.361 --> 17:35.865
And that's actually also a huge advantage to Discord because Discord will literally allow you to just export everything in plain text, no code, no JSON, no none of that, like straight up TXT files of entire channels.

17:36.145 --> 17:38.906
So it's really nice for like providing extra context for this.

17:39.586 --> 17:46.688
Of the first course that I took, half of it was just like Discord channel chats that I'm like keeping up with and want to provide context to the model.

17:47.188 --> 17:58.736
So yeah, I definitely have to, I probably should have by now because Slack is such a big deal, but I'll look into like what makes it easier to like export, you know, these conversations from Slack.

17:58.756 --> 17:59.896
I think that would be helpful.

18:02.458 --> 18:09.482
What would you say is your number one goal at higher dose for, like, do you think you could, is this a thing, a role where you want to move up and get paid more money?

18:09.603 --> 18:10.943
Like you're pretty much like sustaining.

18:11.244 --> 18:16.307
What would make you happy in this situation compared to, and then contrast that with like what they actually want out of the position?

18:16.876 --> 18:19.494
Yeah, meaning, expectations.

18:20.782 --> 18:25.604
And being able to, like, exceeding expectations would make me happy.

18:25.744 --> 18:34.707
What is expected of me is to meet the growth goals of, like, 25% month-on-month growth or year-over-year growth for each month.

18:35.727 --> 18:45.590
And if we are to accomplish that, then I get a 20% bonus from what she shared, which is only, like, I mean, for a year, I don't know how I feel about it.

18:45.650 --> 18:46.811
It's only 20 grand, but...

18:48.803 --> 18:53.624
Which, like, if I can do it through the means of automations, like, that's fire.

18:53.684 --> 18:54.004
Yes.

18:54.484 --> 18:56.885
And then you stack these roles and it becomes easy.

18:56.965 --> 19:01.566
I just become a freelance growth guy and I can charge a higher premium than I am for media buying.

19:02.066 --> 19:08.507
That's also, like, end goal is, like, being able to leverage your skill set to go manage multiple clients as a growth strategist.

19:09.688 --> 19:09.868
And...

19:11.568 --> 19:15.791
Please transcribe in clear, punctuated English, preserving speaker turns.

19:34.102 --> 19:34.823
Okay, last round.

19:54.059 --> 19:55.240
Questions off the top of your head.

19:56.462 --> 19:59.225
Two questions that you would ask the model that would be helpful.

19:59.305 --> 20:00.686
You get started on this project.

20:01.127 --> 20:01.928
You're waking up.

20:01.948 --> 20:03.229
This is one of the first things you attack.

20:03.409 --> 20:04.610
What's something that you would ask it?

20:05.852 --> 20:11.418
Because I want the model to give us context on what would be good to add here to answer these questions.

20:12.031 --> 20:27.025
Yeah, I would basically want to be able to give weekly and daily updates on performance so I can easily slap a message to the CMO and keep her informed on what's going on, either what happened the day before or what happened the last seven days.

20:27.505 --> 20:32.990
Because every Monday I have to deliver a report over the last week, which is why she asked for the...

20:34.191 --> 20:36.472
Audio may include technical terms and names.

20:36.532 --> 20:37.813
Audio may include technical terms and names.

20:50.120 --> 20:51.321
Oh, so it's not in the ad account.

20:51.341 --> 20:55.883
You're talking about just, like, what has changed or what have you done in the last day or the last seven days?

20:56.003 --> 20:56.983
Oh, okay, okay.

20:57.303 --> 20:57.923
That's a little different.

20:58.003 --> 20:58.424
Okay.

20:58.604 --> 21:03.606
Yeah, I mean, some of the data is available in Earthbeam, so it's like, okay, what is the channel performance?

21:03.906 --> 21:06.967
What is the individual channel performance in the Delzos over the last seven days?

21:07.488 --> 21:11.329
The year-over-year growth for the primary channels, which is Facebook and Meadow.

21:11.750 --> 21:13.951
Then what have I been doing on, like, the date?

21:13.971 --> 21:15.951
Like, what are my daily activities, essentially?

21:16.712 --> 21:18.633
And, like, kind of where have I been?

21:18.673 --> 21:19.633
What projects and things?

21:24.901 --> 21:28.862
Yeah, AI is great for stuff like that because it'll just make up a bunch of shit based on what you tell it.

21:29.222 --> 21:29.742
Exactly.

21:30.222 --> 21:31.563
Which is great.

21:32.663 --> 21:34.163
Let me see others that we can report.

21:34.183 --> 21:34.564
What else?

21:34.624 --> 21:35.524
It's literally busy work.

21:35.564 --> 21:36.944
That's so weird to me that they don't.

21:37.284 --> 21:43.366
Wins and updates, challenges, opportunities and solutions, task lists and priorities for the month.

21:43.826 --> 21:46.650
So what would the second question think, you would ask if you think?

21:47.351 --> 21:53.299
So right now, right now, like what happened the day before, the last seven days in a particular channel or primary channels and daily activities?

21:54.360 --> 21:57.625
Year-over-year performance for Meta, Google year-over-year performance.

21:59.087 --> 22:01.570
Any wins and updates for the last seven

22:02.912 --> 22:08.198
Any challenges and then opportunities and solutions.

22:08.738 --> 22:17.747
And like this would need context from also my email for any like opportunities and solutions or challenges and also Slack.

22:18.167 --> 22:21.249
Audio may include technical terms and names.

22:21.289 --> 22:22.750
Audio may include technical terms and names.

22:43.832 --> 22:44.713
Audio may include technical terms and names.

22:44.733 --> 22:46.274
Audio may include technical terms and names.

23:13.601 --> 23:23.640
Two of these calls that was armed with all the context from like every vendor, all the internal communication so that I can communicate on call.

23:24.090 --> 23:25.751
And then take those transcripts and give it to her.

23:25.811 --> 23:28.674
Like my whole role could be automated.

23:28.954 --> 23:30.555
No human playing in this space.

23:30.976 --> 23:39.743
But if I can build that, then it's like now I can take on multiple growth roles without really needing to give the mental cognition.

23:39.763 --> 23:48.530
Because it's like you're just connecting dots for people and like building easier ways for them to contextualize that data.

23:49.588 --> 23:49.949
For sure.

23:50.070 --> 23:50.651
To other people.

23:51.434 --> 23:53.981
Just being a placeholder, like that's honestly what I feel like.

23:54.002 --> 23:57.151
It reminds me of my first marketing role at Advantage where it's like,

24:00.390 --> 24:02.711
Audio may include technical terms and names.

24:02.731 --> 24:04.072
Audio may include technical terms and names.

24:28.740 --> 24:34.423
The context file in the transcript.

24:34.463 --> 24:37.285
So I just wrote a to-do in the to-do dot markdown.

24:37.305 --> 24:39.927
And actually, I'm going to put a header on there.

24:41.208 --> 24:42.328
To-do list.

24:44.650 --> 24:47.011
And I'll just put another header and put organizing.

24:47.031 --> 24:51.554
And then so what I just did is made our first to-do text.

24:53.857 --> 24:58.061
For kind of like getting this higher dose repository going.

25:00.082 --> 25:07.468
Actually, I think what I could do is I think I can make you the admin of this repo so you can take it over on your OU codes account and it'll still be private.

25:07.629 --> 25:10.591
And that way you don't lose any, like you don't have to restart this from scratch.

25:10.931 --> 25:15.495
But everything I just did and showed on the screen, like you pretty much already have access to, you can do it yourself for like other clients.

25:15.815 --> 25:20.780
But I think based on everything you told me, this is probably like the ideal client to do something like this for.

25:21.900 --> 25:23.901
This is like the least clicky.

25:24.101 --> 25:25.322
There's not a lot of action.

25:25.442 --> 25:27.323
I'm just following all this stuff.

25:27.383 --> 25:32.665
It's more just compiling information and data and having the context of everything in order to get it done.

25:32.785 --> 25:34.866
They're asking humans to do language model work.

25:34.886 --> 25:36.667
Yes, exactly.

25:36.827 --> 25:40.469
They just don't know how to get all the data into an LLM to eliminate this role.

25:40.589 --> 25:42.991
Audio may include technical terms and names.

26:05.697 --> 26:05.917
Cool.

26:05.997 --> 26:07.959
Well, I'll wrap it here as far as the tutorial goes.

26:07.999 --> 26:09.420
But like that's my process.

26:09.440 --> 26:15.586
And like I said, it's the more dynamic places like the slacks and the emails are the harder ones to bring in.

26:15.746 --> 26:17.788
But I think also worth that much more.

26:17.828 --> 26:25.655
Like if I could have access to those things, it's just like especially when it's well labeled, which is why I took the time to make the tutorial for the email thing, because it's like once it has like these.

26:27.296 --> 26:30.718
The language, the real language of language models is Markdown.

26:31.458 --> 26:32.519
By default, it's like Markdown.

26:32.999 --> 26:35.120
I would say the next language below that is probably Python.

26:35.140 --> 26:38.862
So they're just really familiar with those languages and that syntax, that formatting.

26:39.202 --> 26:46.026
But if you can get your, I mean, if you just throw in the plain text, like that literally what I'm about to do with the transcript, it does really well.

26:47.028 --> 26:47.729
Thank you for watching.

27:04.778 --> 27:09.321
Okay, this is a last piece that I forgot to go over in this particular transcript.

27:09.341 --> 27:10.942
This is actually an important context.

27:11.463 --> 27:16.106
To get this stuff in the cloud so other people can have access to it, you have to commit the code.

27:16.446 --> 27:18.828
And so what I do typically is I commit one file at a time.

27:19.648 --> 27:21.970
Cursor and VS Code now make this super easy.

27:22.050 --> 27:24.872
It's not so easy in Windsurf, but I don't think you'll be using Windsurf anyways.

27:25.673 --> 27:28.875
You basically come here to where this is the file explorer view.

27:29.355 --> 27:30.436
If you come up here to this...

27:32.276 --> 27:34.517
Control, I think it's the version control view.

27:35.777 --> 27:44.081
You'll see here, Git is already initiated because of the way we did the script initially to set these things up at the beginning of the tutorial.

27:45.081 --> 27:53.144
And basically what you do is like, these are, anytime you see this U, it means that this file is untracked.

27:54.105 --> 27:56.866
Anytime you see the M, it means that this file has been modified.

27:57.006 --> 28:01.668
Anytime you see A, that means the file has been added to the Git, the version control.

28:03.188 --> 28:04.401
To track the changes,

28:07.265 --> 28:11.327
And make a commit, you have to hit this plus button to stage the changes.

28:11.847 --> 28:15.868
So I'm going to stage, actually before I stage the context, I'm going to, no, yeah, I'll stage the context first.

28:16.989 --> 28:24.031
And now it turns to A, this particular file turns to A. You used to have to type in a commit message and like describe what you did and what you added.

28:25.532 --> 28:29.793
But what I'm going to do is actually hit this generate commit message button.

28:30.314 --> 28:32.074
You hit that and it fills in the information.

28:32.094 --> 28:35.776
So it says feature, add context document for health, wellness, and performance reporting.

28:36.696 --> 28:40.800
So it kind of like picked up on what was written into the file and writes a commit message for you.

28:41.101 --> 28:41.881
This is nice.

28:42.182 --> 28:50.550
This makes it great to add context or give good notes on what was committed at what time without you having to do a whole bunch of thinking.

28:50.630 --> 28:52.212
Basically, you don't even have to think about what was committed.

28:52.592 --> 28:53.772
So I'll go ahead and hit the commit button.

28:54.112 --> 29:04.515
There's another little trick that I have here, and I actually commit this here in a second, but there's a utility folder that I have that's default that will actually create commit messages for you.

29:05.195 --> 29:12.676
If this little button is not working and it doesn't work great, you literally can come over here and ask the model to create a commit message for you based on the text, and it'll do a great job.

29:12.736 --> 29:13.637
And then you just copy and paste.

29:13.857 --> 29:19.598
Because sometimes, I don't know why this gets rate limited, but I have had times where like this button stops working for like an hour.

29:20.198 --> 29:22.119
So I figured out a way around it.

29:22.439 --> 29:25.201
Anyways, I'm going to take this to-do list, stage the changes.

29:26.422 --> 29:28.002
Oops, I hit the commit button too early.

29:28.222 --> 29:29.823
Let me discard the commit message.

29:30.324 --> 29:32.485
I need to generate the commit message using AI.

29:33.025 --> 29:35.867
And I was saying there's a feature of adding a to-do list for organizing tasks.

29:35.947 --> 29:36.607
I hit the commit.

29:36.927 --> 29:37.567
It's not committed.

29:37.968 --> 29:45.392
What this means is that these commits have been added to the repository on your local machine.

29:46.499 --> 29:48.761
So only locally have these commits happened so far.

29:49.141 --> 29:51.762
If you want to push them up to the cloud, that's what these buttons here are for.

29:52.283 --> 29:53.424
You can fetch from remote.

29:53.584 --> 29:54.204
You can pull.

29:54.304 --> 29:57.426
This is when you open the terminal and type git pull.

29:57.566 --> 29:58.967
It's basically the same thing as you're hitting this button.

29:59.067 --> 30:02.430
It just pulls in all the new changes from the repository from the cloud.

30:02.810 --> 30:07.973
Or you hit the push button, and the push means any local changes that you have on your computer, it gets pushed up to the cloud.

30:08.473 --> 30:09.414
So we're going to go ahead and push it.

30:09.854 --> 30:11.315
Or you hit that sync changes button.

30:11.335 --> 30:12.216
It all does the same thing.

30:12.596 --> 30:13.217
Sync just does...

30:13.797 --> 30:14.577
Thank you for watching.

30:29.225 --> 30:32.026
Adding code to open source repository and trying to contribute.

30:32.486 --> 30:33.386
For the most part, it doesn't matter.

30:33.406 --> 30:35.627
I just hit the sync button and it gets the job done.

30:36.307 --> 30:44.290
Now that we have these things committed, anyone who clones this repository or uses the repository on their own machine sees exactly what we see here.

30:45.030 --> 30:49.852
If I was to go in and add another here, how about this?

30:51.372 --> 30:51.973
I'll delete that.

30:52.453 --> 30:56.154
I'll go in and add another comment onto the to-do list.

30:59.520 --> 31:04.525
And I'll say, add the transcript to the repo.

31:06.166 --> 31:09.169
And what you see over here on the left-hand side is that this part turns green.

31:09.549 --> 31:14.774
And that just means that this line is brand new since the last commit.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.256
So it'll show you what changes you've made.

31:17.276 --> 31:19.358
So let's say I go in and like, hey, I don't like organizing anymore.

31:19.378 --> 31:20.058
Let me just delete it.

31:22.080 --> 31:22.361
Now,

31:23.604 --> 31:32.468
It's saying, okay, for this, the next commit that you do, this file has been modified and it's been modified to remove organizing and add a new to-do list item.

31:33.129 --> 31:37.631
So like it literally just keeps track of all the changes you make to text, which is really nice in my opinion.

31:37.651 --> 31:40.052
As someone who's like so text-based.

31:40.472 --> 31:42.753
So I'm going to revert that change because I don't actually like that change.

31:42.893 --> 31:46.535
Actually, let me keep some of that because I like the new.

31:46.955 --> 31:51.978
And then again, what I would do is come in here to the version control little piece of the tab.

31:53.979 --> 31:55.520
Stage the changes by hitting the plus button.

31:56.560 --> 31:57.701
Hit generate commit message.

31:58.201 --> 31:59.001
I don't have to think about it.

31:59.021 --> 32:01.903
It just says update to-do list, because that's exactly what I did, and then hit commit.

32:02.823 --> 32:12.727
Once that commit is made and all of my local commits have been committed, essentially, to the version control, added to the version control, I can just hit this sync button, which will push my commit up to the main.

32:13.528 --> 32:15.909
I like to hit okay, don't show again, but it doesn't really matter.

32:18.052 --> 32:18.994
Okay, now it's up to date.

32:19.074 --> 32:20.977
Now you have everything I have on this local computer.

32:21.898 --> 32:31.734
And in that case, I'm going to take this file, add it together with the last one to make one complete part two, and then transcribe it and add it to the repository.
