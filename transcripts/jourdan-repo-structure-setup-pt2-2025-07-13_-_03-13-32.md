## Company Background Questions

**Q: What does higher dose do in your words?** (06:19.671)
- **A:** They sell health and wellness electronic devices. Along with, like, beauty topicals. And then, you know, electronic devices in beauty and supplement space.

## Role and Responsibilities Questions

**Q: What was the last task that your higher-up asked you?** (06:59.992)
- **A:** Simo asked for a one-pager report on the first half of the year's performance and comparing it to last year. So previous year for the same six months.

**Q: On a day-to-day basis, how often do you get to touch the ads?** (07:33.523)
- **A:** I'm not touching the ads at all. I'm communicating with the agency that manages the ads or the vendors that manage our ads across various channels.

**Q: For the onboarding, who on the team did they have you meet?** (08:08.740)
- **A:** I had to meet the agencies I met or internal team members that I would be working with. Or just like vendors to explain agencies, internal team members. And I had already met higher levels of the team through the interview process. So I didn't necessarily have to meet with them again. But there is one, like he's the, I wouldn't call him like the CFO. But he oversees a lot of the tech, finance. He's kind of like a multi-hat kind of guy, HR stuff. So I deal with him fairly often.

**Q: On a day-to-day basis, what are you trying to automate when dealing with higher dose? What actually matters to you the most?** (09:54.887)
- **A:** Compiling the reports and building it. A lot of it is replying to vendors and email threads and communicating with the agency to stay on top of the deliverables and action items that they have in order for me to contextualize what's going on on these channels. To the CMO who then communicates it to the rest of the team.

## Goals and Automation Questions

**Q: What would you say is your number one goal at higher dose for, like, do you think you could, is this a thing, a role where you want to move up and get paid more money?** (18:02.458)
- **A:** Yeah, meaning, expectations. And being able to, like, exceeding expectations would make me happy. What is expected of me is to meet the growth goals of, like, 25% month-on-month growth or year-over-year growth for each month. And if we are to accomplish that, then I get a 20% bonus from what she shared, which is only, like, I mean, for a year, I don't know how I feel about it. It's only 20 grand, but... Which, like, if I can do it through the means of automations, like, that's fire.

## Model Questions for Automation

**Q: Two questions that you would ask the model that would be helpful. You get started on this project. What's something that you would ask it?** (19:54.059 - 20:04.610)
- **A:** Yeah, I would basically want to be able to give weekly and daily updates on performance so I can easily slap a message to the CMO and keep her informed on what's going on, either what happened the day before or what happened the last seven days. Because every Monday I have to deliver a report over the last week.

**Q: What would the second question think, you would ask if you think?** (22:46.650)
- **A:** Yeah, I mean, some of the data is available in Earthbeam, so it's like, okay, what is the channel performance? What is the individual channel performance in the Delzos over the last seven days? The year-over-year growth for the primary channels, which is Facebook and Meadow. Then what have I been doing on, like, the date? Like, what are my daily activities, essentially? And, like, kind of where have I been? What projects and things?
