- **2025-06-23 09:56** *Anastasia*: I jus saw this on Pinterest yesterday too.\n\n📎 **IMG_8310.jpg** (jpg, 200.9KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F093A72AQ48/img_8310.jpg)
- **2025-07-14 17:38** *Chris Jacob*: @Anastasia how do these codes work "ShopMy Lookbook Discount"
- **2025-07-15 06:54** *Anastasia*: Are these showing up on Shopify next to a product order amount totaling $0 ? 
- **2025-07-15 06:55** *Chris Jacob*: Yes
- **2025-07-15 06:55** *Anastasia*: If yes then that is agency eight gifting via ShopMY 
- **2025-07-15 07:00** *Chris Jacob*: apologies if this was my misunderstanding from that call but this can't function that way
- **2025-07-15 07:01** *Chris Jacob*: they're using regular skus and a 100% discount code instead of $0 skus
- **2025-07-15 07:01** *Anastasia*: They should be using the free SKU’s 
- **2025-07-15 07:02** *Anastasia*: We gave them the SKU’s with the C at the end - is that still incorrect?
- **2025-07-15 07:02** *Chris Jacob*: can you have them immediately pause additional ordering while we sort
- **2025-07-15 07:02** *Chris Jacob*: no thats correct but then they wouldnt need a discount code
- **2025-07-15 07:02** *Anastasia*: Yes will do! Can you please share the correct SKU names with me and I’ll get that adjusted asap
- **2025-07-15 07:03** *Anastasia*: We haven’t given them a discount code - may be because it’s going through ShopMY.
- **2025-07-15 07:05** *Chris Jacob*: yes i see it coming in as a code but not in the normal course so somewhere in the chain its generating something that allows this
- **2025-07-15 07:06** *Chris Jacob*: i thought they were going to input orders (like our cs agents do) but this implies maybe the individual creators are placing their own choice of order through some system or something
- **2025-07-15 07:06** *Chris Jacob*: easiest to just get on call with them probably figure out together
- **2025-07-15 07:12** *Chris Jacob*: they asked for 200 gifts and have sent 179 so if the remaining 21 are alredy in process lets proceed as is i dont want creators to hit some tech roadblock
- **2025-07-15 07:12** *Chris Jacob*: can fix for go forward
- **2025-07-15 07:35** *Anastasia*: Ok, I let them know to hold. It will be a ShopMY thing - need to work with them directly. 
- **2025-07-15 07:36** *Anastasia*: Will get it sorted out today.
- **2025-07-15 12:34** *Chris Jacob* 💬 1 reply: @Anastasia ok you can go back to telling them to outright stop they're doing this also creating their own $0 orders
- **2025-07-15 12:34** *Chris Jacob* 💬 2 replies: 📎 **image.png** (png, 203.4KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F095XGCGKH8/image.png)
- **2025-07-15 12:35** *Anastasia*: I have asked them to stop and I have reached out to SHopMY - the issue is that they have already sent over gifting requests to creators and they are going in and accepting them. Trying to swap over SKu's - waiting on ShopMY to get back to me.
- **2025-07-15 12:38** *Chris Jacob*: if there's a reasonably limited # of those remaining (between these two groups they're near or beyond 200) it's not worth frustrating creators themselves we'll just deal with it on back end
