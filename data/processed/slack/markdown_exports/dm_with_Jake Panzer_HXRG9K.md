- **2025-07-01 13:18** *Jake Panzer (@jake)*: I'll make sure to circle back

- **2025-07-09 12:44** *Jake Panzer (@jake)*: Hey Jourdan, I'm actually free rn. Do you want to get on a quick huddle?
- **2025-07-09 12:45** *Jake Panzer (@jake)*: I just feel like there's quite a few moving parts on Google right now and definitely want us to be on the same page
- **2025-07-09 12:51** *Jourdan*: Yeah man let’s jump on 
- **2025-07-09 12:51** *Jourdan*: Can do huddle or Google meets

- **2025-07-10 10:01** *Jake Panzer (@jake)*: Hey Jourdan, just reaching out and giving you a heads up about our GA4 tracking setup.  
  
For context, we received a warning from Shopify that the current Google tag setup might break when they update their checkout flows around August. They recommended that we set up Google tags through the Google &amp; YouTube shopify plug in to avoid this risk. To get ahead of this, we set up a call with Google’s tag specialist team. On the call, we managed to successfully complete the new tag configuration for Google Ads, but the GA4 tracking migration is still in progress.  
  
I’ll loop you into the email thread shortly and share the next steps as I see them. Ideally, I’d love for you to act as the bridge between the Cardinal team (managing the live site and current tags) and the Annatta team (managing the new site theme and tag configuration) to carry out this migration smoothly. Does that work for you? Let me know :blush: Alternatively, I can be the bridge too but wanted to align with you first.
- **2025-07-10 13:44** *Jourdan*: Yeah man that works for me. I haven’t been introduced to either parties on site management yet so this will be a good intro for me so I have context. Thank you for aligning with me first!
- **2025-07-11 06:05** *Jake Panzer (@jake)*: Of course Jourdan! Will loop you into the thread shortly

- **2025-07-16 12:49** *Jake Panzer*: Hey Jourdan :relaxed:, looping back on the TROAS adjustment on Google Ads (and sorry for the delay here!).  
I know Tori suggested testing this on the **Non-Brand Sauna Blanket Pmax** campaign but that campaign is actually one of the campaigns driving **incremental revenue as a result of the Pmax scaling test**, so I’d recommend leaving it as is for now to ensure we end up capturing that campaign as a part of the scaling test. Also don't want to pull back on something that's working.  
What are your thoughts on testing the TROAS adjustment on the **US*PMax*Brand*Consumables** campaign instead? That’s one of two campaigns that hasn’t shown incremental revenue post-scaling. The other is **US*PMax*Brand*AllProducts**, but since that campaign was the most heavily scaled, adjusting TROAS there might risk ending the scaling test prematurely.  
Let me know what you think!
- **2025-07-16 21:28** *Jourdan*: Hey @Jake Panzer I’m aligned with your perspective on leaving Non-Brand SB campaign alone. The Consumables campaign is at a 2.71 L7 in platform with spend down 5% so what do you think will happen to the performance here?  
  
All products performance looks great so that campaign is rebounding compared to previous period and I wouldn’t want to mess with T ROAS.
- **2025-07-16 21:29** *Jourdan*: We’ve really got to push revenue so getting soft on spend isn’t ideal

- **2025-07-17 07:02** *Jake Panzer*: Got it Jourdan. In that case do you want to hold off on the TROAS scale given that it will certainly cause lower spend in whichever campaign we decide to implement it in? ROAS will likely improve but spend will certainly drop in that campaign, although, we can assess by how much it drops by, so we have some sort of a baseline. Let me know how you feel.
- **2025-07-17 13:30** *Jourdan*: Yeah i agree we should probably hold off on it for now. We should be done with the spend test tomorrow right?\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Jake Panzer*
