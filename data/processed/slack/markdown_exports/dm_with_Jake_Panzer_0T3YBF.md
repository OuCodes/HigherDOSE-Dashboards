- **2025-07-02 16:16** *Jourdan*: Yo @Jake Panzer would love to know your thoughts on how we can take bigger swings at aligning the entire account behind single product campaigns?
- **2025-07-02 16:17** *Jourdan*: There’s a big push behind the summer of testing internally so would love to get this process going but don’t want to disrupt the account with too many changes at once
- **2025-07-02 16:20** *Jourdan*: I consider Red Light Hat, Infrared Sauna Blanket, and PEMF Pro Mat as the hero products for paid media and we’ll be pushing more efforts towards those so may be a good starting point with campaigns
- **2025-07-03 09:58** *Jake Panzer*: Hey Jourdan! Sorry for the delay here I was OOO yesterday- I'll get back to you shortly
- **2025-07-03 10:43** *Jourdan*: No worries thank you sir!
- **2025-07-03 14:18** *Jake Panzer*: So sorry to keep you waiting- I totally agree and this is something Meta is pushing internally too! I think one by one we can get the individual product campaigns built out like we discussed with red light. I think it's totally reasonable to have all 4 individuals built out in the next week and a half/two weeks, I just want to talk to the team about how they feel to best pace it out
- **2025-07-03 14:19** *Jourdan*: Okay awesome thanks man! Getting some internal pressures to get it swapped over sooner than later so i’ll be following up more frequently on it but i trust what you all are doing
- **2025-07-03 14:20** *Jake Panzer*: That's great context to know- we'll make that a huge priority of next week once everyone's back from the holiday
- **2025-07-03 14:28** *Jourdan*: Thank you sir!
- **2025-07-03 14:33** *Jake Panzer*: Of course! Happy 4th man- have a good one
- **2025-07-03 14:44** *Jourdan*: Same to you brother! Enjoy your holiday \n\n*Reactions: :saluting_face: Jake Panzer*
- **2025-07-03 16:47** *Jake Panzer*: Last thing before the weekend- weird bug going around ads manager today which isn't allowing us to duplicate and change the the attribution of the campaigns so I'll check back tonight and have it done latest Monday!
- **2025-07-03 19:04** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good sir thanks for the update\n\n*Reactions: :saluting_face: Jake Panzer*
- **2025-07-16 11:33** *Jake Panzer*: hey hey! just wanted to double check if we're still on for CAC review? no problem if not
- **2025-07-16 20:07** *Jourdan*: Yo! Who all from SB needs to be on the bark call? @Jake Panzer
- **2025-07-17 09:23** *Jake Panzer*: We'll roll pretty deep to this one- let me grab the emails

- **2025-07-17 15:27** *Jourdan*: Just sent the email out!
- **2025-07-17 15:53** *Jake Panzer*: Thank you sir!
- **2025-07-22 12:39** *Jourdan*: yo @Jake Panzer we didn’t get to touch on bark on call today but Chris wants to touch base before leveraging that tool to establish CAC KPIs by product
- **2025-07-22 12:40** *Jourdan*: He’s not 100% on their data and if they’re necessary in the ecosystem
- **2025-07-22 12:41** *Jourdan*: So not sure if the full team above is needed but we just want to have a short call to understand the needs for each channel to figure out CAC targets
- **2025-07-22 12:42** *Jake Panzer*: Oh interesting- totally understand. if necessary we can definitely do it by Prescient/Northbeam but that would be a great convo to have
