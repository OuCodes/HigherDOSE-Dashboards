1
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:01,571
bit more on our platform.

2
00:00:01,651 --> 00:00:07,096
And then we can dive a little bit deeper into the nitty gritty and figure out where the best use kits for you guys is right now.

3
00:00:07,857 --> 00:00:11,720
So let me know if you can see my screen here.

4
00:00:15,542 --> 00:00:23,170
So essentially, Ridge is an AI platform that powers smarter data collection so you can build relationships everywhere.

5
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:31,018
Whether that's someone buying through retail, buying through Amazon or even receiving a gift around the holiday season.

6
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:34,939
That was something that I was gonna touch on a little bit after, and maybe I can bring it up now.

7
00:00:35,499 --> 00:00:43,722
Is gifting like a big part of the business right now, especially like leading into the holidays, or do you not really have too much oversight on that?

8
00:00:44,342 --> 00:00:53,645
Yeah, at the moment, I don't, I would assume so, given the nature of the products and how many bundles we offer, expensive gifts for sure, but just like face masks.

9
00:00:54,905 --> 00:01:10,380
is a popular product that I imagine a lot of gifting done there, but I don't think gifting is like a language that's been focused on historically and trauma correct me if you guys have more insight there, but yeah, I think traditionally people buy the products themselves.

10
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:18,695
The only time we went into gifting is during like a mother's day, a father's day, at least so far in our experience with the brand.

11
00:01:18,795 --> 00:01:27,801
And even then we still have a hunch that people are buying it mostly for themselves except for the product red light, which is a red light hat.

12
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:31,163
Like we can see that like women are buying that for men.

13
00:01:31,964 --> 00:01:36,947
But like the face mask we don't think is a gifting excuse.

14
00:01:37,027 --> 00:01:39,809
I wouldn't say it's like a common path.

15
00:01:42,148 --> 00:01:42,368
Okay.

16
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:52,756
And I guess the reason why I'm asking that because the whole purpose of bridge, and of course, as we expand deeper into what exactly it is, we do, it's to capture customers wherever they may be.

17
00:01:53,056 --> 00:01:58,840
So when we're looking at products that can be gifted, you'll never know who that person ends up being.

18
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:08,728
So by utilizing, you know, bridge, we're able to help you capture those folks at any point that someone makes, you know, contact with your product.

19
00:02:08,748 --> 00:02:11,590
So that's kind of why I just asked about the whole gift and a part of things.

20
00:02:13,427 --> 00:02:14,547
So you're muted.

21
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:17,148
I don't know if you were just agree, but yeah.

22
00:02:17,288 --> 00:02:17,588
Okay.

23
00:02:17,608 --> 00:02:17,888
All right.

24
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:19,249
Cool.

25
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:25,950
So essentially bridge right now we are working with over 160, you know, top global brand.

26
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,352
So, you know, you have your conglomerates in the world, the Skull Candies, the Heineken's, the Chobanes.

27
00:02:32,412 --> 00:02:33,672
And let me see here.

28
00:02:33,872 --> 00:02:34,853
I dive a little bit deeper.

29
00:02:35,213 --> 00:02:39,354
So essentially everywhere your customers are, we can be too with bridge.

30
00:02:39,634 --> 00:02:39,774
So

31
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:49,446
Taking a look here, we can empower you guys via digital wings on your socials, packaging displays, and then in real life as well.

32
00:02:49,546 --> 00:02:54,029
So if you are running events, we're able to really show

33
00:02:55,069 --> 00:03:07,694
where your product lives and be able to present to ourselves as you expand out on events, but given you don't really oversee that, we can save that part of the conversation for some other folks on your team as well.

34
00:03:08,294 --> 00:03:10,215
And if you can dream it, bridge can power it.

35
00:03:10,675 --> 00:03:21,120
So these are a ton of our use cases, obviously not all of them make a ton of sense for you guys, but a few areas where I do see this resonating would be product education

36
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:30,648
reviews, warranty registrations, and then maybe some like early access for some new products coming down the line.

37
00:03:30,948 --> 00:03:31,148
Right.

38
00:03:31,308 --> 00:03:36,092
So few of our use cases here where we're really empowering our brand.

39
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:39,535
So submitting reviews, being in the wellness space,

40
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:48,989
reviews mean everything whenever I'm buying a new product like a red like maps, for example, I'm always scouring the internet for reviews and seeing, you know, what other folks are thinking.

41
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:55,553
You know, event activation sweepstakes, influencer channels, which is a route that you were talking to as well.

42
00:03:56,093 --> 00:03:57,594
And then education, right?

43
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,635
You're using a new mask.

44
00:03:58,895 --> 00:03:59,616
How do I use it?

45
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:06,180
How long do I use it for being able to empower folks to have that sort of education at the palm of their hands?

46
00:04:08,052 --> 00:04:09,014
is obviously super important.

47
00:04:09,034 --> 00:04:11,139
So I'll kind of stop there really quickly.

48
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,184
I know I kind of just ran through a few slides.

49
00:04:13,464 --> 00:04:17,454
So if you have any questions so far, feel free to, feel free to ask away.

50
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:22,715
No questions, but the review section was pretty cool.

51
00:04:23,195 --> 00:04:30,740
I definitely think, you know, I need tools and can leverage to facilitate more reviews from our customers, you know, will be helpful.

52
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:36,164
And I believe you mentioned contact career partnerships as well with Bridge.

53
00:04:36,745 --> 00:04:37,305
I'll ever do that.

54
00:04:37,365 --> 00:04:37,765
Yeah.

55
00:04:38,206 --> 00:04:38,386
Yeah.

56
00:04:38,606 --> 00:04:42,108
Talk to me a little bit about your review capture right now.

57
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:45,691
What are you, what are you guys currently doing along that front?

58
00:04:46,104 --> 00:04:47,264
I'd love to hear more than you.

59
00:04:47,324 --> 00:04:52,326
We probably claim you, um, segmentations to push for reviews.

60
00:04:53,087 --> 00:04:59,929
Uh, don't know if we're leveraging any QR codes, um, or the channels or like tools we're using for, to generate reviews.

61
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:12,914
Um, on the website, but I do know they positioned them well, uh, and leverage them in a content, but as far as just like getting exposure to more reviews, I don't know if there's like a outside of this, like, sitting play, or attending

62
00:05:13,494 --> 00:05:27,647
SMS messages, I'm not sure if there's a very conscious effort there, but again, Charlotte brands, if you guys know, any insights there, or if you've run any specific campaigns, then, well, if you're not.

63
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:27,707
No.

64
00:05:28,848 --> 00:05:35,754
Not exactly yet, but I'm really excited to see what's possible and what you guys have to switch your tests to.

65
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,357
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

66
00:05:39,157 --> 00:05:39,757
Let me see.

67
00:05:39,777 --> 00:05:48,441
I'm going to pull up an experience that we actually built for you guys so you can see what it looks like in the wild through QR activation.

68
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:55,264
And if you guys don't have QR codes on your packaging right now, we can make these work via a digital link as well.

69
00:05:55,364 --> 00:05:58,045
So you'd be able to plug those into your social channels.

70
00:05:58,165 --> 00:06:04,347
Jordan, give your phone out by any chance of your phone on you or if you scan this QR code, I can make it a little bit bigger too.

71
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:22,946
It doesn't work.

72
00:06:23,407 --> 00:06:25,007
I can just I could just pull it right up.

73
00:06:25,027 --> 00:06:25,408
Don't worry.

74
00:06:26,788 --> 00:06:27,289
There you go.

75
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:28,889
It's a couple tries to get it to click.

76
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:29,910
But now I've got to pull that now.

77
00:06:30,894 --> 00:06:31,814
All right, cool.

78
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:35,235
So these are, essentially, these are our bridge experiences.

79
00:06:35,635 --> 00:06:39,657
And this is how we really empower brands to start collecting that first party data.

80
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:46,399
So since we're integrated with Shopify, we can extract all of your assets directly from there.

81
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,240
So imaging in video, you don't have to go out and start recreating anything for your products.

82
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,521
We can actually go in there and just do a simple API integration.

83
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,062
We can drag and drop and build these out.

84
00:06:56,122 --> 00:06:57,242
I'll show you the backend.

85
00:06:57,782 --> 00:06:59,423
Probably not on this call.

86
00:07:00,043 --> 00:07:06,646
We'll probably have to schedule a second call to dive into the actual back end of the platform, but to show you how we could bring your brand to life.

87
00:07:09,027 --> 00:07:11,348
This is again, what those bridge experiences would look like.

88
00:07:11,468 --> 00:07:18,932
So right now, the call to action that we've put in a place that we believe would make a ton of sense for your products would be like registering your product.

89
00:07:20,163 --> 00:07:24,145
So you'd click here, you'd activate, and then we'd collect email from there.

90
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:26,966
But we can build out these flows, however you want to.

91
00:07:27,006 --> 00:07:28,507
We can get extremely creative here.

92
00:07:29,107 --> 00:07:38,311
So aside from just registering your product for that warranty activation, we're able to shop directly from a bridge experience and then buy accessories.

93
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:40,632
You can really put out whatever sort of products you want.

94
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,433
That education component, right?

95
00:07:43,453 --> 00:07:48,616
So learning more about the brand, if we want to tailor these out specifically to products, we can educate folks there.

96
00:07:49,542 --> 00:08:01,191
bulking a treatment, but then also that review section building out the flow there so we can drive more reviews for either the brand or the individual products depending on what you guys need.

97
00:08:01,831 --> 00:08:02,932
I'll kind of stop there.

98
00:08:04,373 --> 00:08:05,514
See if you have any questions so far.

99
00:08:07,188 --> 00:08:08,249
No, I like the flow of this.

100
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,853
I think definitely we can attach it to packaging and it would be a great experience.

101
00:08:13,153 --> 00:08:26,224
And just like getting more people dry, especially like the book of treatment for those that are close to the spot or bought locally and being able to, I guess, find other solutions or book at the local spot they were on yet.

102
00:08:26,945 --> 00:08:28,506
And then the shop now experience.

103
00:08:28,566 --> 00:08:30,168
I guess how are you guys tracking this?

104
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:33,710
Do you have a tool for measuring?

105
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:34,810
Do you guys have analytics?

106
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:42,733
Are you kind of past long UTMs and allow the measurement tools we use to track the sales driven premise from Bridge?

107
00:08:43,993 --> 00:08:48,315
Yeah, so I guess I can jump in here to kind of answer a couple of those.

108
00:08:48,335 --> 00:08:49,635
So, absolutely.

109
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:55,717
So how we're tracking it is like any data collected in Bridge gets passed through real time to both Shopify and Clavio.

110
00:08:56,097 --> 00:09:00,579
So we actually create a profile in Shopify for anyone that we're capturing.

111
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:06,603
So what's going to happen is let's say I buy a higher dose mat on Amazon.

112
00:09:06,624 --> 00:09:08,285
I register the products.

113
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:09,966
I'm going to be in your systems.

114
00:09:10,226 --> 00:09:16,751
Your team's going to be sending me or Shama really is going to be sending me like probably great retention marketing flows and different things like that.

115
00:09:17,572 --> 00:09:21,918
I might eventually convert and buy those accessories on your Shopify site.

116
00:09:22,499 --> 00:09:24,082
We can actually tag that revenue.

117
00:09:24,562 --> 00:09:29,109
So we can start to track what we consider like offline to online revenue through the air.

118
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,753
So you can see like the general traffic on.

119
00:09:32,774 --> 00:09:50,118
any of these bridge experiences or pages, but we also with that deep Shopify Clavio integration can see like, wow, it actually matters that we're connecting with our quote unquote offline or unknown customers, because now we're seeing in three months they tend to spend 300 more dollars or whatever the case is there.

120
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,679
Yeah, on the revenue piece.

121
00:09:56,707 --> 00:10:01,371
And then on the meta piece and Sharma team, this is actually new since we've last spoken.

122
00:10:01,411 --> 00:10:09,558
And I probably owe you like a lot more enablement around this, but we now are rolling out functionality with meta on the channel ads.

123
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:18,044
So this is a really cool way for your team to start to get credit of like, you pushed me an ad, but I didn't check out from your Shopify site.

124
00:10:18,205 --> 00:10:19,245
I both is at Nordstrom.

125
00:10:20,006 --> 00:10:24,188
But because I registered the product, we can actually tie that profile together.

126
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,170
So you can see like the meta ad did work.

127
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,992
I just ended up buying an offline scenario.

128
00:10:30,492 --> 00:10:35,335
So I think also like that's a really interesting connection point and play for you all.

129
00:10:35,475 --> 00:10:41,838
It just takes those meta dollars a lot further and you could start to see the value of like, okay, we are reaching people.

130
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:44,700
They're just not purchasing on that D to C flow.

131
00:10:47,562 --> 00:10:48,102
That's really cool.

132
00:10:49,235 --> 00:10:51,677
And then you're not a curiosity there.

133
00:10:51,877 --> 00:11:01,505
Do you know who or who to where to those like meta dollars or meta ad spend kind of live through on your team currently?

134
00:11:01,525 --> 00:11:10,552
Because I know you guys are running 88 campaigns and I know that they're not cheap by any means, but would love to hear a little bit there if you like.

135
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,774
We're investing in product.

136
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:19,712
No, like, who's responsible for running those, those meta ads or yeah.

137
00:11:20,673 --> 00:11:21,573
Okay, you're doing on that.

138
00:11:21,673 --> 00:11:22,634
Okay, fantastic.

139
00:11:23,815 --> 00:11:23,955
Yeah.

140
00:11:23,995 --> 00:11:28,880
So we run all like pans on keyboard of the D to C support.

141
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:34,244
So it can be meta to talk, Apple and Google Pinterest.

142
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:38,072
And then we don't touch Amazon.

143
00:11:38,312 --> 00:11:39,754
That's sort of our collaboration.

144
00:11:40,195 --> 00:11:40,615
That's fair.

145
00:11:40,635 --> 00:11:43,018
And Jordan is like overseeing it all.

146
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:44,820
I'm like experiential channels.

147
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,180
Yeah.

148
00:11:45,641 --> 00:11:48,885
So I would say like Jordan, I want to kind of tie this all together for you.

149
00:11:48,945 --> 00:11:53,210
So I think like the registering your product play is like a

150
00:11:54,051 --> 00:11:58,152
I'm going to say, like, brain dead use case for you guys for post-purchase capture.

151
00:11:58,232 --> 00:12:01,192
Like, I think this will help you know your customer so much better.

152
00:12:01,252 --> 00:12:06,553
It's going to drive up retention, connecting people, et cetera.

153
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:11,194
But I also heard you say, like, you're really focused on top of funnel growth as well.

154
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:13,394
Like, how are you going to, like, help drive that?

155
00:12:13,414 --> 00:12:22,716
I think the meta component, this will help you see kind of the tail end of, like, add dollar spent who and where people are converting.

156
00:12:23,496 --> 00:12:44,871
I think the other things that we've seen folks take advantage of from a bridge perspective is any sort of like place you're showing up whether it's a direct mail campaign or just like top of funnel and digital strategies, sending people to a bridge experience can capture their email even if they're not ready to purchase and then your team can nurture them post email capture.

157
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:49,594
So we see some folks like build a bridge experience and that call to action will be like

158
00:12:50,194 --> 00:12:52,177
unlock your wellness guide from higher dose.

159
00:12:52,618 --> 00:12:56,763
That might not be a higher dose customer yet, but they're interested in that content exchange.

160
00:12:57,304 --> 00:13:00,388
We're going to capture email because it's the one click email capture.

161
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:05,515
Then you get to nurture them and kind of help them and not nudging them to purchase flow.

162
00:13:05,575 --> 00:13:05,715
So

163
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:11,557
The point here is like, we're definitely a platform and you can kind of like pull all these different use cases.

164
00:13:11,637 --> 00:13:18,940
So I want to be clear, like, I think the registry or product is incredible for like this post purchase, know your customer, nurture them.

165
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:26,062
But I think being able to tie that into some of your brand awareness, like pre-purchase campaigns becomes really interesting.

166
00:13:26,562 --> 00:13:28,602
And then we like layer in the meta component.

167
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,323
So all those dollars go further.

168
00:13:31,584 --> 00:13:36,867
Yeah, no, I appreciate you giving that example definitely connects a few more dots on how we can leverage this.

169
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:42,551
For top of funnel channel extension, especially, I mean, register your product and be able to track retail sales.

170
00:13:43,011 --> 00:13:52,357
It's just like another layer for attribution, which will be super helpful in measuring the impact of a channel like meta or TikTok as well.

171
00:13:52,378 --> 00:13:55,219
Stuff that it may not have or campaigns that may not have that

172
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,081
linear path to conversions and attribution, you can still see there's lift in other ways.

173
00:14:01,901 --> 00:14:05,382
We are bringing out additional tools to track that, but that is pretty interesting.

174
00:14:06,682 --> 00:14:14,684
Another thing that we didn't touch on, and I know we just have two minutes, but Jordan, what's your guys' philosophy or policy on discounting?

175
00:14:14,804 --> 00:14:16,905
Do you guys do discounting today?

176
00:14:17,605 --> 00:14:20,865
So I know we're moving away from being a discount heavy brand.

177
00:14:20,925 --> 00:14:23,566
That's been like a huge focus in years as well, which is

178
00:14:23,966 --> 00:14:32,728
Also been a struggle just for, you know, going into the ecosystems of these paid channels without having being able to leverage those discounts, you can see the impact on conversion rates.

179
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:47,611
So I won't say you're like, there are opportunities for us to push sales and, you know, have discounts, but it's not going to be a primary focus, like we didn't run up for the July campaign this year, which also I don't believe we ran it last year, but it's just kind of moving away from that and

180
00:14:48,491 --> 00:14:50,933
being more of a premium brand positioning.

181
00:14:51,614 --> 00:14:53,855
Yeah, do people shop every day?

182
00:14:54,396 --> 00:14:56,638
And the welcome offer just to anchor that is 10%.

183
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:01,501
So it is a very, like, that shows sort of the philosophy.

184
00:15:01,882 --> 00:15:07,646
Yeah, that's actually helpful because what we've seen some of our customers do that I think are in a very similar position to you.

185
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:15,592
They're not giving a 20, 30, 40% off is we also support rebates, which people primarily use for in-store purchase.

186
00:15:16,153 --> 00:15:17,034
So it's a different

187
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:18,595
discount motion.

188
00:15:18,655 --> 00:15:23,540
It's like, you have to opt into a rebate, then go purchase the product and upload your receipt.

189
00:15:23,921 --> 00:15:25,662
The consumer gets a Venmo back.

190
00:15:26,123 --> 00:15:32,169
So some people will do it very specifically of like, we want to make a huge splash because we're launching in Target.

191
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:38,694
Hey, if you go up into this rebate and then buy and store up what you receive, you'll give them a back of $20.

192
00:15:39,275 --> 00:15:42,077
But we see it as like top of funnel acquisition.

193
00:15:42,177 --> 00:15:50,163
People opt in a lot to the rebate, but your discounting is much lower of like who's actually getting off their couch and going to purchase.

194
00:15:50,603 --> 00:15:59,530
But that can be an alternative way that folks have approached getting away from these like big, big discounts, but more so like a cashback component.

195
00:16:02,868 --> 00:16:11,392
That's awesome, especially, you know, being able to use the peer-to-peer money transfer platforms, like let people get that back a little bit quicker and instantly, so that's cool.

196
00:16:12,053 --> 00:16:14,254
Yeah, it's just a different psychology play.

197
00:16:14,494 --> 00:16:21,818
Like, they're still spending that like two, $300 amount, but then they have that like $20 in their Venmo account, which people love.

198
00:16:22,758 --> 00:16:23,899
Yeah, not for sure.

199
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:31,683
And I guess how does that tech work or how does that play into what would you need for the brand to be able to execute something like that?

200
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:41,599
Yeah, so basically you all would set the offer type and then you build it in the bridge platform, which is like the no code builder, and then you all decide how you want to do the distribution.

201
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,801
So I'm sure like the Sharma team would help with that.

202
00:16:44,122 --> 00:16:46,344
A lot of folks just push that through a meta ad.

203
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:53,611
And then we facilitate everything into end the data collection, the receipt validation and the payouts.

204
00:16:53,951 --> 00:16:56,233
So it's a pretty white glove service on our side.

205
00:16:57,122 --> 00:16:57,522
Yeah.

206
00:16:57,562 --> 00:16:58,902
No, go ahead.

207
00:16:59,182 --> 00:17:00,023
No, go ahead.

208
00:17:00,063 --> 00:17:00,503
Go ahead.

209
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:02,723
Where I think it could get tricky just currently.

210
00:17:03,163 --> 00:17:05,423
There's no matter ad spend supporting retail.

211
00:17:06,184 --> 00:17:09,444
And so I think that is a big business decision.

212
00:17:10,444 --> 00:17:24,927
There's also no matter ad spend like that supported prime, for example, like meta and the paid budgets that we are handed at least on our side are strictly to drive to the D to C. So I think that would probably need a pivot in

213
00:17:25,588 --> 00:17:32,459
strategy or experiential budget because the offline sales aren't

214
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:39,152
traced, which, to your point, could be really powerful, but they're also not incentivized from the, the paycheck.

215
00:17:39,452 --> 00:17:39,912
Gotcha.

216
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,073
That makes sense.

217
00:17:41,173 --> 00:17:41,433
Yeah.

218
00:17:41,513 --> 00:17:42,534
I mean, it's a really good point.

219
00:17:42,574 --> 00:17:46,576
I think like some people run them without the paid.

220
00:17:46,596 --> 00:17:54,380
Obviously, there's less eyeballs there, less, like a Nordstrom specific micro influence arc, which honestly works.

221
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,162
But anyways, I know we're also over time.

222
00:17:57,222 --> 00:17:59,643
So, Guy, let me kick it over to you for next steps.

223
00:18:00,745 --> 00:18:03,607
Yeah, Jordan, I was just going to say obviously there's a lot to unpack here.

224
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:07,069
What I would love to do is find some time for us to chat next.

225
00:18:07,229 --> 00:18:14,714
I want to take you through the actual back end of the platform and show you how to actually build out these experiences because we can get extremely creative with them and soak in your team.

226
00:18:15,851 --> 00:18:19,952
But it can get a little complicated, and it's better to actually see how they're built out.

227
00:18:21,073 --> 00:18:23,733
And then also showing you the full back end of the platform.

228
00:18:23,773 --> 00:18:28,495
So showing you all that tracking, where all the data lives, and how we can pass all that over to you.

229
00:18:28,515 --> 00:18:32,736
Again, it's just going to take a little bit more time for me to show you all of that information.

230
00:18:33,236 --> 00:18:41,719
So I wanted to see if you had some time like mid next week for us to reconvene and pick back up on the conversation.

231
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:48,102
Yeah, Wednesday, Thursday, or Tuesday, Wednesday, that's more simple for a midweek check-in.

232
00:18:48,423 --> 00:18:49,023
We can do then.

233
00:18:49,043 --> 00:18:52,204
I would say Tuesday is a little bit more availability.

234
00:18:52,404 --> 00:18:53,765
Are you also based in New York City?

235
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:55,866
No, I'm in Boston.

236
00:18:56,466 --> 00:18:57,347
Okay, cool, cool.

237
00:18:57,367 --> 00:18:58,507
So it's still just in time.

238
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:02,669
I'm central or I will be central then too.

239
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:05,650
So cool.

240
00:19:07,031 --> 00:19:11,953
I could do either next Tuesday after like

241
00:19:13,266 --> 00:19:13,687
2 p.m.

242
00:19:13,907 --> 00:19:15,188
or Wednesday is pretty open.

243
00:19:15,248 --> 00:19:16,389
Anything after 2 p.m.

244
00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:17,690
on Wednesday is pretty good for me.

245
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:18,951
We can go 2 30 on Tuesday.

246
00:19:19,031 --> 00:19:22,214
Actually, no, let me.

247
00:19:22,314 --> 00:19:23,735
Is there is an ignorant.

248
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:30,581
Ingrid is out on till Tuesday, I believe, and I do want to like Ram robin with her as well prior to speaking again.

249
00:19:31,001 --> 00:19:34,204
So if we could do Wednesday and what are your times Wednesday?

250
00:19:35,766 --> 00:19:36,887
Yeah, no, I could do Wednesday.

251
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:38,928
You want to do same time 2 30 Eastern?

252
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:40,530
Is that what you were?

253
00:19:42,745 --> 00:19:44,186
That one might be a little bit of a screen.

254
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:45,227
Yeah, let me see.

255
00:19:45,627 --> 00:19:46,407
Do you have anything?

256
00:19:46,788 --> 00:19:51,831
Yeah, I could do one Eastern.

257
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:52,771
Does that work?

258
00:19:53,552 --> 00:19:54,352
Yeah, that would work.

259
00:19:55,593 --> 00:19:56,013
All right, cool.

260
00:19:56,233 --> 00:19:57,854
I'll shoot out an invite for you.

261
00:19:57,995 --> 00:20:05,599
And then let me tie up an email kind of going over everything we talked about, but pretty much for the next call, we'll look to go into the back end of the platform.

262
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:06,500
And again, I'll just show you.

263
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:08,780
how to build them out.

264
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,483
It's super easy, but then showing me the back end to the platform too, so you can see where we track everything.

265
00:20:13,683 --> 00:20:17,386
But I'll summarize everything in an email and get it off to you in the next couple of hours or so.

266
00:20:17,826 --> 00:20:18,086
All right.

267
00:20:18,106 --> 00:20:18,507
Sounds good.

268
00:20:18,947 --> 00:20:19,207
Awesome.

269
00:20:19,227 --> 00:20:19,768
Appreciate it.

270
00:20:19,948 --> 00:20:20,888
Thanks for everybody.

271
00:20:21,189 --> 00:20:21,969
Great to see you all.

272
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:22,990
Happy Friday.

273
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,251
See you.

274
00:20:25,832 --> 00:20:26,853
I think the tool's valuable.

275
00:20:27,373 --> 00:20:31,176
It feels like we're not strong.

276
00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:38,518
All right.

277
00:21:16,806 --> 00:21:18,112
What do you think I did it?

278
00:23:10,285 --> 00:23:11,070
Oh, that was a good deal.

279
00:23:51,656 --> 00:23:54,998
Yes, our own insurance, and you can only have one primary provided.
