1
00:00:01,128 --> 00:00:02,929
31 days in July.

2
00:00:02,949 --> 00:00:10,876
So July has regular days.

3
00:00:10,896 --> 00:00:18,382
31 or like whatever and then there's like sale days.

4
00:00:18,402 --> 00:00:23,907
And you're like, okay, on a sale day or like you can do a weekday.

5
00:00:26,946 --> 00:00:31,229
This is probably more accurate because there is a lot of fluctuation in our business between weekdays and weekends.

6
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:33,490
Right.

7
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:40,074
So you can go, okay, there's like this many weekdays in July.

8
00:00:40,094 --> 00:00:42,195
Let me just do it real quick while I'm here.

9
00:00:42,636 --> 00:00:46,298
There's like one, two, three, four, five, 10, 15, 20, 23.

10
00:00:46,998 --> 00:00:47,459
Oh my God.

11
00:00:58,411 --> 00:00:58,792
Sorry.

12
00:00:58,812 --> 00:01:00,193
23 and then we have.

13
00:01:00,213 --> 00:01:00,594
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 weekends.

14
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,234
And then we have, let's say, four sale days.

15
00:01:22,274 --> 00:01:24,416
I'm just making this up or two sale days.

16
00:01:24,496 --> 00:01:25,656
We might do a flash sale.

17
00:01:26,657 --> 00:01:29,318
And then you can be like, on an average day, we make 40K.

18
00:01:29,358 --> 00:01:30,699
On a weekend, we do 60K.

19
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,241
And on a sale day, we do 100K.

20
00:01:40,854 --> 00:01:47,636
Just making this up and you can look at like the averages on GA to confirm that, but that's kind of somewhat class probably.

21
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:55,137
So, and then you've got this equals this times this.

22
00:01:56,698 --> 00:01:58,678
And then you pull your formula down.

23
00:01:58,698 --> 00:02:02,919
And then you've got a total.

24
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:10,181
Boom bang thing.

25
00:02:11,078 --> 00:02:11,558
Okay.

26
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:25,708
Would you do this for like July 24 and 25 or like month by month would you go through and do this just to kind of get maybe not but it'll give you more of like a granular insight into how each month performs.

27
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:27,690
You want to get

28
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:32,541
to the most accurate of these inputs.

29
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:40,004
But what I would do is I would triangulate last year, the last three months, you know what I'm saying?

30
00:02:40,044 --> 00:02:47,407
So like the closer in accuracy you get to what these special days look like, the closer your total is going to become.

31
00:02:47,607 --> 00:02:48,808
And so what I would do is

32
00:02:50,457 --> 00:02:56,499
I would do it both ways just because you're learning the business and also there is a lot of fluctuation in the business.

33
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:09,023
So you kind of want, so if this exercise gets you to two million and this exercise only gets you to 1.6, you're like, okay, what is off here?

34
00:03:09,343 --> 00:03:18,366
If these are within 100K of each other, you're basically at your, you're at a pretty accurate point here.

35
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:23,700
using two different models to project the numbers and they're close and similar to each other.

36
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,180
Yeah, that makes sense.

37
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:26,121
Yeah.

38
00:03:29,102 --> 00:03:30,103
You learn and Jordan?

39
00:03:30,723 --> 00:03:31,063
Yeah.

40
00:03:31,463 --> 00:03:34,605
I mean, like visual examples like this help my brain out so much.

41
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,125
Of course.

42
00:03:36,265 --> 00:03:36,486
Yeah.

43
00:03:37,226 --> 00:03:38,366
That's what I'm here for.

44
00:03:38,646 --> 00:03:38,947
Awesome.

45
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:39,247
Thank you.

46
00:03:40,162 --> 00:03:40,422
Of course.

47
00:03:41,402 --> 00:03:51,404
Okay, so Q3 and then same thing with all the other months, but start with July and just like, you know, use now the logic that I know you have, which is like, all right, paid social.

48
00:03:51,444 --> 00:03:57,966
If we're like, oh man, we really like, that's shitting the bed right now, meta, like, I'm not going to rely that heavily on it.

49
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:02,267
Or man, I actually think if we invest, we can get this amount of traffic.

50
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:07,628
And then you may also want to put into here like a spend.

51
00:04:09,688 --> 00:04:10,168
assumption.

52
00:04:10,188 --> 00:04:11,188
Yeah.

53
00:04:13,029 --> 00:04:21,770
So if you're like, okay, spend on actually not to make this even more complicated, but you know, that's what we do sometimes, spend low end.

54
00:04:22,711 --> 00:04:24,871
And then you want to go spend high end.

55
00:04:26,691 --> 00:04:27,532
Where are you feeling?

56
00:04:27,952 --> 00:04:28,132
Yep.

57
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:32,013
So you may end up having different.

58
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:33,173
Whoops.

59
00:04:35,713 --> 00:04:39,114
And with 2024, because that data is already there, it's probably easier to

60
00:04:40,677 --> 00:04:43,398
Like we put them actually, it can be actualized for 2024.

61
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:46,780
And what, 2025, we would do the high end low end fragile.

62
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:47,780
That's right.

63
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:49,241
Cool.

64
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:50,682
Yeah.

65
00:04:50,742 --> 00:04:58,585
And you'll actually, in that case, you would have two traffic on the high and the low.

66
00:04:58,685 --> 00:04:59,065
Gotcha.

67
00:04:59,125 --> 00:04:59,325
Yeah.

68
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,106
That makes sense.

69
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:00,980
Right.

70
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,721
So traffic.

71
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:03,242
Hi.

72
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,725
And then traffic.

73
00:05:06,345 --> 00:05:06,685
Oh, I know.

74
00:05:06,705 --> 00:05:08,847
I realized I'm doing this on the other Y tab.

75
00:05:08,887 --> 00:05:12,390
That's confusing.

76
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,292
So I'll just change these.

77
00:05:16,114 --> 00:05:16,954
See what I did there.

78
00:05:16,974 --> 00:05:17,055
Yeah.

79
00:05:20,598 --> 00:05:20,878
Oops.

80
00:05:36,104 --> 00:05:36,884
This is making sense.

81
00:05:37,484 --> 00:05:38,364
Yeah, no, definitely.

82
00:05:40,045 --> 00:05:40,265
Cool.

83
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:47,586
Okay, so hit it with this and then definitely clean up some of your assumptions on the year.

84
00:05:47,606 --> 00:05:47,686
Okay.

85
00:05:53,127 --> 00:06:02,049
I am going to actually just make a new version of my master because it's getting messy and I don't want that many people in it.

86
00:06:03,049 --> 00:06:03,269
So

87
00:06:06,297 --> 00:06:08,919
Let me get that real quick.

88
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:26,390
I think messy, messy, messy.

89
00:06:28,092 --> 00:06:29,813
My file make coffee.

90
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,381
Share, shareable.

91
00:06:49,049 --> 00:06:52,291
And the one you want me working on is the existing one or the new one?

92
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:53,692
A new one.

93
00:06:54,132 --> 00:06:54,613
OK, cool.

94
00:06:55,213 --> 00:06:57,615
Do you want me to revert changes on the existing one?

95
00:06:58,995 --> 00:06:59,716
No, that's OK.

96
00:06:59,976 --> 00:07:02,198
I'm down once we're here with you.

97
00:07:02,518 --> 00:07:02,798
Cool.

98
00:07:04,394 --> 00:07:22,623
Because here's what'll happen is like, if you're in the middle of workshopping, but being Chris are looking at it for other reasons, he's going to be like, you're July target, or Sharma's going to be like, you're going to be good, and I'm like, no.

99
00:07:22,883 --> 00:07:29,087
So, okay, let me give you access to this one.

100
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,561
All right, now you have the shareable one.

101
00:07:41,845 --> 00:07:42,865
Let me know if you're in it.

102
00:07:52,691 --> 00:07:56,574
Not shareable, maybe shareable is a bad way of team.

103
00:08:04,432 --> 00:08:04,832
sheet.

104
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:08,694
Okay, now you're in it.

105
00:08:09,294 --> 00:08:09,615
Good.

106
00:08:11,315 --> 00:08:12,156
So then.

107
00:08:13,556 --> 00:08:16,458
Yeah, mess with these summaries first and then we can go into.

108
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:22,701
It's like we definitely ought to build in some of that growth here.

109
00:08:25,987 --> 00:08:35,416
And you also have to remember our spend in July and August on non-lower funnel activity.

110
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:47,248
So like the testing that we want to do on YouTube, on mountain, on like all those things, that needs to happen in July, August, September and Q3 so that we lock in

111
00:08:49,594 --> 00:08:50,175
that juice.

112
00:08:50,835 --> 00:08:52,897
Okay.

113
00:08:53,757 --> 00:09:04,606
And the mountain mountain is like 10k is what we could get away with like 15 was the the you get a wrap 10k was just like recommended starting by the game.

114
00:09:04,686 --> 00:09:04,966
Great.

115
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:04,966
10.

116
00:09:06,147 --> 00:09:06,407
Yeah.

117
00:09:06,507 --> 00:09:06,727
Yeah.

118
00:09:06,907 --> 00:09:07,228
Yeah.

119
00:09:07,788 --> 00:09:08,068
Okay.

120
00:09:08,989 --> 00:09:12,131
Let me just make some notes for myself to consider those things.

121
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:13,012
Yeah.

122
00:09:13,032 --> 00:09:17,375
So that's what I think we should do that on a separate slide here.

123
00:09:17,395 --> 00:09:19,377
So actually know what I'm going to clean some of this up.

124
00:09:21,087 --> 00:09:22,989
look or spend, you don't need any of that.

125
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,751
I'm gonna delete the side because you don't need it.

126
00:09:27,372 --> 00:09:36,680
And then the side of it.

127
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:45,347
I do think that in these individual pages, so like, okay, wait, shoot, I'm not sharing my screen.

128
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,691
I'm in the worksheet and then I'm in the month, right?

129
00:09:51,187 --> 00:10:00,641
on these guys, we should have more detailed breakout here and what we're doing.

130
00:10:00,681 --> 00:10:03,405
So for example, I just put these numbers in.

131
00:10:06,495 --> 00:10:07,696
for like demand gen.

132
00:10:07,776 --> 00:10:12,640
And when I'm saying demand gen maybe that's confusing and we can name it whenever we want together.

133
00:10:13,481 --> 00:10:16,604
But this is like a one to one investment.

134
00:10:16,764 --> 00:10:21,228
Like I'm not giving it the same row as goal as these guys.

135
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:26,893
And that's just meant to be our like awareness and top of funnel stuff.

136
00:10:27,353 --> 00:10:31,517
And even one to one is like high expectations for that type of thing.

137
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:35,786
So am I best understanding Demand Jenna just made like the new way to run YouTube?

138
00:10:39,148 --> 00:10:39,509
Yeah.

139
00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:41,430
Well, that's why I want to rename it.

140
00:10:42,931 --> 00:10:46,474
Because all I'm saying here is like top of funnel.

141
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:47,094
Yeah.

142
00:10:47,495 --> 00:10:47,595
OK.

143
00:10:49,257 --> 00:10:50,218
Google top of all.

144
00:10:51,638 --> 00:10:53,879
Well, no, it doesn't have to be limited to it.

145
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,600
So like, okay.

146
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,141
Oh, okay.

147
00:10:58,221 --> 00:11:00,121
Yeah, now I see where the confusion is coming.

148
00:11:00,281 --> 00:11:02,242
Yeah, yeah, we should definitely not.

149
00:11:02,422 --> 00:11:03,283
Like everything.

150
00:11:03,703 --> 00:11:06,724
Yeah, yeah, it's more criminal as a strategy.

151
00:11:07,024 --> 00:11:11,706
Yeah, Google could include mountain could include all this other.

152
00:11:11,766 --> 00:11:14,407
Yeah, yeah, I get you, I get you, I get you, I get you.

153
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:18,948
Yeah, yeah, let's do it because I'm I'm specifically thinking demand in campaigns.

154
00:11:19,469 --> 00:11:21,969
Product type in Google when that when that comes to mind.

155
00:11:21,989 --> 00:11:23,050
So that's helpful.

156
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:28,732
I'm glad you pointed that out because I would have gone more days without recognizing that word exactly.

157
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:30,172
So I think that.

158
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:39,535
This is maybe where we we for like our level of oversight and simplicity.

159
00:11:39,555 --> 00:11:41,756
I think we keep it to these three.

160
00:11:41,776 --> 00:11:43,157
But then Sharma.

161
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:50,132
And you together need to have way more detail, right?

162
00:11:50,152 --> 00:11:54,775
So like under this paid social, there's probably like four things.

163
00:11:54,855 --> 00:12:02,900
There's like meta, there's like, there's even like, what are we doing in reals versus like all of those things is like, there's like more here.

164
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:08,864
But for the sake of this document, I only care that paid social is this and this.

165
00:12:10,902 --> 00:12:11,582
Yeah.

166
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:14,744
I mean, when it comes to those channels, it's going to vary either way.

167
00:12:14,804 --> 00:12:16,625
Based on performance, some things may not worked out.

168
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:18,405
And we're going to kind of like pinch this, right?

169
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:24,568
Like we may have allocated X amount of dollars to pinch this, but that's going to get rotated and changed if it's all worked out.

170
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:24,868
Yeah.

171
00:12:25,789 --> 00:12:30,050
So that that level of detail needs to be captured.

172
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:32,732
I don't need it captured here.

173
00:12:33,272 --> 00:12:33,532
Gotcha.

174
00:12:35,413 --> 00:12:39,957
So all I care about is that the line item of paid social.

175
00:12:41,538 --> 00:12:42,880
This is how much we're spending.

176
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,281
This is how much we're getting.

177
00:12:44,361 --> 00:12:46,122
This is the efficiency in the channel.

178
00:12:50,166 --> 00:13:00,355
Where is like you and Sharma should know all of the different variables and like channels and activities that ladder up to paid social.

179
00:13:03,827 --> 00:13:05,148
Okay.

180
00:13:05,188 --> 00:13:06,069
Yeah, no, for sure.

181
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:13,317
I definitely considered it more in the weeds than it comes like the tactical, like, hey, what are we optimizing towards on these channels?

182
00:13:13,998 --> 00:13:21,265
Obviously, we have overall goals, but it's just like, how can we get to those overall goals by making sure we use the right products on these channels?

183
00:13:22,026 --> 00:13:25,267
So that's that's your job and charm is right.

184
00:13:25,927 --> 00:13:49,651
My job is to be like Jordan and Sharma you have a hundred thousand dollars for this channel and I expect this how this much out of it and you need to know based on the the performance and the like you know lately we've done that it out like you can be like ingrid that is totally accomplishable or ingrid you are smoking crack here's what I think this channel should actually be

185
00:13:52,028 --> 00:14:00,996
Yeah, the July efficiency is like my only concern because we don't have like we've got the fourth of July but we're not doing the sale and then we don't have the product push.

186
00:14:01,117 --> 00:14:02,498
So that's why I'm in where in July.

187
00:14:02,938 --> 00:14:07,302
So that's the only thing that makes me nervous is like that five, seven top line because we just came off a five month.

188
00:14:08,804 --> 00:14:15,150
But I think workshopping through this will give me more confidence around or clarity when I was possible.

189
00:14:15,683 --> 00:14:17,625
So that's where I'm saying it's like, tell me.

190
00:14:17,886 --> 00:14:20,228
And again, like within the month, you can shift.

191
00:14:20,388 --> 00:14:20,909
I don't care.

192
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:23,592
How does that efficiency is the efficiency, right?

193
00:14:23,632 --> 00:14:31,101
So getting on top of Google, I was like, man, there's like, there's efficiency and some top line that we can capture.

194
00:14:31,501 --> 00:14:32,883
Let's lean into that, right?

195
00:14:34,051 --> 00:14:49,172
So you're not married to these allocations and I think you know that but that's where like the other document that we just created is going to help you right because you're going to be like okay we were we were forecasting that.

196
00:14:51,713 --> 00:14:57,674
this that like social is going to give us this traffic and this conversion rate and this amount of sales, right?

197
00:14:58,474 --> 00:15:03,955
And actually, it's tracking that we're getting this amount of, you know, sales from that.

198
00:15:04,015 --> 00:15:06,136
And so we need, we need to change that.

199
00:15:06,876 --> 00:15:13,997
Or you could be like, all right, that first week, if we were going to do at this pace, then we're behind or we're ahead and did it out.

200
00:15:14,077 --> 00:15:20,178
So like once you have this, you can then workshop into like what in the,

201
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:28,036
Basically, what's being broken and how do we need to reallocate resources?

202
00:15:28,576 --> 00:15:29,877
Yeah, that's clear to me.

203
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:38,703
And just based off of like gut feeling with Google is like, with the push up, I hope it maintain like the cactus and blow out too high to where throws are blended off.

204
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:42,186
I mean, anything lower than Facebook and spending more is going to be good overall.

205
00:15:42,886 --> 00:15:47,069
But yeah, that's just where like, I know we're scaling Google.

206
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:51,292
We've got to wait two weeks before we can really determine if it's successful or not, but that's like,

207
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,033
another week into the month.

208
00:15:53,573 --> 00:15:57,416
And if we're going to push hard on Google, we probably need to be scaling more.

209
00:15:58,496 --> 00:16:02,039
So yeah, we're shopping through this is definitely going to help get more clarity there.

210
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,301
But just knowing off of how this stuff works, that's where my concern is at.

211
00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:09,744
And I'm like, OK, Google looks good, but I know we probably need to be pushing harder if we're going to hit our goals.

212
00:16:10,764 --> 00:16:11,565
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

213
00:16:11,665 --> 00:16:14,507
And that's where like, you know, this isn't like a set and forget it.

214
00:16:14,547 --> 00:16:17,449
That's why there's humans that need to manage this stuff.

215
00:16:18,274 --> 00:16:25,136
But yeah, I think, and again, if we're like dropping some efficiency here and there, like, you got to just let me know.

216
00:16:25,156 --> 00:16:27,036
And then I can pull other lovers.

217
00:16:29,897 --> 00:16:30,117
Word.

218
00:16:30,697 --> 00:16:30,817
Okay.

219
00:16:33,957 --> 00:16:39,759
And then if you're like, look, the main thing is the top line with the, with the, with the spend goal.

220
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:44,360
If one of these needs to go, you let me know the worst case scenario is

221
00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:48,950
that we drop in our efficiency.

222
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:57,892
What is the lowest efficiency, because looking at Q2, everything's been about four.

223
00:16:57,912 --> 00:16:59,853
You guys are really, really efficient.

224
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:03,694
What is low considered low in the eyes of the business?

225
00:17:08,456 --> 00:17:10,297
And four is low.

226
00:17:10,577 --> 00:17:11,537
Yeah, that's crazy.

227
00:17:12,978 --> 00:17:16,739
I mean, we've run a tight ship around here, Jordan.

228
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,280
Yeah, that's crazy.

229
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:25,662
Yeah, because I, yeah, no, I've seen Breadskill hard at like two, but I know like the economics are different.

230
00:17:25,762 --> 00:17:32,185
So that's when I'm also wrapping my head around because you guys have such a huge AOV, but I also know it costs more to manufacture the types of products you sell.

231
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:36,266
So the margins are like, the economics might be a little bit different than what I'm used to.

232
00:17:38,717 --> 00:17:39,377
But yeah, yeah.

233
00:17:40,037 --> 00:17:40,238
Okay.

234
00:17:42,998 --> 00:17:43,199
Yeah.

235
00:17:43,339 --> 00:17:45,179
I mean, I'm going to say I'm going to say a four.

236
00:17:45,859 --> 00:17:47,320
It's like, that's the floor.

237
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,661
That's, that's impressive.

238
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:51,181
I know, man.

239
00:17:51,201 --> 00:17:53,082
We've got a tight ship around here.

240
00:17:53,122 --> 00:17:53,302
Yeah.

241
00:17:53,382 --> 00:17:53,862
Yeah.

242
00:17:54,422 --> 00:17:56,343
Do not, do not, do not, do not.

243
00:17:57,063 --> 00:17:59,764
Um, even, okay, appetite for like volume.

244
00:17:59,824 --> 00:18:03,005
I'll say you guys start to say, I mean, January, Q1, there's a million in spend.

245
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:04,446
What was that efficiency at?

246
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:07,447
Let me do that real quick.

247
00:18:08,968 --> 00:18:10,209
I'm curious like what is it look?

248
00:18:10,249 --> 00:18:11,911
Yeah, I came down to three five two.

249
00:18:12,552 --> 00:18:13,432
Yeah, I was back.

250
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:14,213
Yeah.

251
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:15,975
Hey.

252
00:18:16,275 --> 00:18:19,158
Okay.

253
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:19,739
Okay.

254
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:20,960
Cool.

255
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,022
There's other stuff for you, Jordan, right?

256
00:18:24,924 --> 00:18:28,167
It's like, we're doing more sampling and more affiliate.

257
00:18:28,227 --> 00:18:31,030
We're doing more, but we look at those historicals, man.

258
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,912
Yeah, no, it's in probably like, it's like 2023 is a six.

259
00:18:34,972 --> 00:18:37,454
I mean, obviously it wasn't a million in spin.

260
00:18:37,474 --> 00:18:48,221
24 is a five on 600, so adding another 400 shouldn't have realistically brought it down that much for your changes, advertising platform gets more expensive, more software, each other.

261
00:18:49,622 --> 00:18:50,162
In January?

262
00:18:51,023 --> 00:18:54,285
That's the old agency fired in March.

263
00:18:56,606 --> 00:18:57,067
Okay, 352385.

264
00:18:57,307 --> 00:19:00,449
So then they were struggling for three months.

265
00:19:02,816 --> 00:19:11,799
And when did they join on with higher dose, like the prior, prior, you're like, well, 2024, what month's within energy?

266
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:14,340
I guess this is what I'm trying to ask.

267
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,780
I'm sorry, full time in January.

268
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,661
I only gave him three months.

269
00:19:17,701 --> 00:19:19,921
They got you day.

270
00:19:20,121 --> 00:19:21,542
Yeah.

271
00:19:21,582 --> 00:19:24,423
They came out to get swinging on a million and spend that's insane.

272
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:32,612
Yeah Wow, because yeah, you guys were not pushing that hard in the month leaving up prior.

273
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:33,592
I mean, okay.

274
00:19:33,612 --> 00:19:41,938
I see December 2.9 November 1.3, but yeah, but that's what you're expecting to do in January.

275
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,600
We do have a pretty big pullback because I was looking at that.

276
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,481
I was like, why was a million spending key want like January?

277
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:47,942
Like is it?

278
00:19:49,196 --> 00:19:54,278
Usually, like most of the brands I've worked with in the beauty space, they've got a pretty big pullback in January.

279
00:19:54,298 --> 00:19:58,119
I know you guys have more health and wellness, but like these products do lean into beauty as well.

280
00:19:58,179 --> 00:20:00,380
But yeah, it's interesting.

281
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,362
But New Year and New Me, so maybe that's where they thought they'd be able to continue that volume.

282
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:12,980
Yeah, because even like the spin to sales, you're basically your media, your murder percentages has been fairly low across the board.

283
00:20:13,101 --> 00:20:14,783
Like, you know, 20% is like high for you guys.

284
00:20:14,803 --> 00:20:18,169
So like over 20, 20 plus is.

285
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:19,831
Yeah, our goal is like a 22.

286
00:20:19,872 --> 00:20:20,012
Yeah.

287
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:23,383
That's what I'm saying.

288
00:20:23,403 --> 00:20:27,666
That's where the, the, like, this year.

289
00:20:27,846 --> 00:20:30,568
So like, this is where, okay, so now let's like come to Jesus here.

290
00:20:30,588 --> 00:20:35,292
This thing, this is what I live and die by.

291
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:45,399
We have to get to, like, and I will tell you right now, if we get to here, you will get a fat ass bonus for me.

292
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,401
Okay.

293
00:20:47,501 --> 00:20:47,641
Like,

294
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,791
that ask bonus, like, fucking 20%.

295
00:20:51,011 --> 00:20:55,073
It is worth your focus.

296
00:20:56,974 --> 00:20:59,115
I will make sure you are paid.

297
00:21:00,775 --> 00:21:01,376
We can do it.

298
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:02,456
That's the whole thing.

299
00:21:02,616 --> 00:21:04,377
I have no doubt.

300
00:21:04,577 --> 00:21:07,638
We also, you got to remember, there's a couple of things that are working in our favor.

301
00:21:07,879 --> 00:21:10,460
So just talk about the tailwinds, I get that.

302
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,260
Here are your headwinds.

303
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,121
Here are your tailwinds.

304
00:21:14,181 --> 00:21:17,563
We're launching two more products before the end of the year.

305
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:19,073
Beautiful.

306
00:21:19,134 --> 00:21:20,718
It's like a medium product.

307
00:21:20,778 --> 00:21:23,426
It's not going to do what the body sculptor did, which is the red light wrap.

308
00:21:23,747 --> 00:21:25,512
The other one is the shower head.

309
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:28,453
Oh, yeah, you got it.

310
00:21:28,673 --> 00:21:29,953
Yeah, you got to shoot an October.

311
00:21:30,433 --> 00:21:30,753
Okay.

312
00:21:30,993 --> 00:21:32,394
Yeah.

313
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:33,994
Yeah, shower heads are gonna crush.

314
00:21:34,354 --> 00:21:35,514
Definitely need founder videos.

315
00:21:35,554 --> 00:21:37,155
I'll tell you that just from experience and run.

316
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:38,055
Oh, yeah, yeah.

317
00:21:38,095 --> 00:21:39,435
Found a like creative is going to.

318
00:21:39,515 --> 00:21:43,376
And Lauren, you're not gonna get a better founder-led video than Lauren.

319
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:48,598
Lauren's like smoking hot, so smart, so good at like talking to camera.

320
00:21:48,638 --> 00:21:49,378
She's perfect.

321
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:50,900
So you'll get those.

322
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,265
And again, that's where so now you're starting to see all the puzzle pieces together.

323
00:21:54,525 --> 00:22:02,698
That's where those briefs that you're working on with Laura are really important because like if it doesn't have a brief, it's not getting created.

324
00:22:03,484 --> 00:22:31,426
Yes, and her and I spoke yesterday Around just brief some like the direction we want to go and getting Sharma more aligned like hey, here's the core products you guys need to be hitting on like routinely because Sharma's kind of not like necessarily shooting in the dark with creative, but it's a bit sporadic So we just there's definitely probably four products We need to focus on that are driving great LTV numbers and we need some more consumption that like obviously the son of like it needs to be innovated on that performance is dropping but

325
00:22:32,487 --> 00:22:39,450
Yeah, we've got a few ideas working in that direction, and then we even spoke on just the inference on itself, because that's high-tech opportunity.

326
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:43,092
Different approach to marketing that, but could help out a lot, too.

327
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:45,257
Exactly, exactly.

328
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:48,179
So Laura is my right hand.

329
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:49,359
I trust her with everything.

330
00:22:49,379 --> 00:22:50,420
I think I already told you this.

331
00:22:51,581 --> 00:22:58,044
Make sure that you guys are like combining your powers because between the two of you, this is like the power center.

332
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,846
So definitely work closely with Laura.

333
00:23:00,866 --> 00:23:03,608
The other piece is, I don't have any insight into this.

334
00:23:03,628 --> 00:23:04,869
So I have to rely on you.

335
00:23:06,109 --> 00:23:11,813
Where are we with the meta campaigns being restructured to be at the item level?

336
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:17,472
I don't think they've taken any direct action on doing that.

337
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:21,474
I need you to be a pit bull with them.

338
00:23:21,674 --> 00:23:22,735
Okay, okay.

339
00:23:22,915 --> 00:23:25,456
I'm like, get it, actually switch the campaign last week.

340
00:23:26,437 --> 00:23:31,600
They relaunched a double campaign, and I think that's a line, but largely it counts still segmented out.

341
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:32,620
No.

342
00:23:33,201 --> 00:23:34,922
But yeah, I'll be more like,

343
00:23:35,882 --> 00:23:47,627
Because I've been on the other side, and I've taken too much of a passive role, just not telling them exactly what to do, but there's a few things that I want to see change, that I'm trying to influence about, just like, hey, do this, do that, do this.

344
00:23:48,147 --> 00:23:52,969
But I'll be more directive around, hey, we need to be doing this in your own account.

345
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:58,592
Please make these changes, and just telling them what I want to see so that we can get things switched around a little bit faster.

346
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:00,953
You are here to do that.

347
00:24:02,254 --> 00:24:05,535
I would say all of that is expected of you.

348
00:24:05,555 --> 00:24:09,857
It's a approach that is important, right?

349
00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:12,539
So like don't go in there and seem roll the shit out of them.

350
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,101
Go in there and have a good conversation with our boy, Jay.

351
00:24:16,141 --> 00:24:17,761
He's a sweetie pie pumpkin.

352
00:24:17,821 --> 00:24:22,424
Like he's not going to like the ego test to go with you or anything like that.

353
00:24:23,104 --> 00:24:31,130
If you're, if like, you have that conversation with him of where you're like, I really want to like, for me, this is me talking, not me impersonating you.

354
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:36,013
Ingrid wants all of our campaigns to be structured at the product level.

355
00:24:36,773 --> 00:24:37,134
Period.

356
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:39,805
What's our path to getting there?

357
00:24:40,065 --> 00:24:43,948
How do we do that with the least disruption to our current setup?

358
00:24:44,629 --> 00:24:45,669
And guess what?

359
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:53,275
If we need to swallow a week of disruption where we toss everything into learning, I'm okay with that.

360
00:24:54,102 --> 00:24:59,086
But just like, help me what that risk is and how long we need to grin and bear it.

361
00:25:00,147 --> 00:25:13,639
And then if you have other stuff like minor optimization stuff that you've been holding back, have that conversation with Jake, give him your logic, have him share his logic with you, and then you're both going to come into a better realization together.

362
00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:14,469
Okay.

363
00:25:14,709 --> 00:25:14,949
Cool.

364
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:22,253
Like we're still working together versus just telling him, like I want to play at the seed, give him the ability to come up with the ideas of how we navigate there.

365
00:25:23,174 --> 00:25:28,417
So he doesn't feel just from like meet from a media buyer perspective on how I go.

366
00:25:28,477 --> 00:25:30,158
So I also know how to approach it.

367
00:25:30,178 --> 00:25:32,939
So I'll go ahead and get a reach out to him.

368
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:33,940
And we'll get him.

369
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:41,224
At the end of the day, if we aren't doing this in this way, I'm going to hold you accountable, not Charmo.

370
00:25:43,186 --> 00:25:45,048
because you were the higher dose employee.

371
00:25:45,528 --> 00:25:45,789
Yes.

372
00:25:48,071 --> 00:25:48,571
Thank you.

373
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:55,378
What else?

374
00:26:00,463 --> 00:26:01,985
Really, that wasn't my camera this whole time.

375
00:26:02,005 --> 00:26:03,126
I was just yelling hi.

376
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:05,128
My hair.

377
00:26:09,061 --> 00:26:10,262
How do you enjoy the red light?

378
00:26:10,422 --> 00:26:15,806
Honestly, I'd assume that was just a regular hat that you were wearing, but it is like the hard-dose red light hat, right?

379
00:26:16,407 --> 00:26:17,848
Oh, yeah, I use it all the time.

380
00:26:18,268 --> 00:26:18,868
It's so great.

381
00:26:19,469 --> 00:26:23,192
It works.

382
00:26:23,212 --> 00:26:25,774
I lost so much hair after I had my second kid.

383
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:28,356
Is that a normal thing?

384
00:26:28,416 --> 00:26:28,556
Yeah.

385
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:36,443
your hormones going like crazy and all sorts of fun stuff happens.

386
00:26:36,864 --> 00:26:42,269
Yeah, what you guys go through so much to continue this game we call life.

387
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,271
Yeah, you sacrifice a lot.

388
00:26:45,351 --> 00:26:52,898
So my hat goes off to you for doing that and signing up to reproduce because that is a big commitment.

389
00:26:53,498 --> 00:26:55,100
What's also like what we're here to do.

390
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,641
I agree.

391
00:26:56,761 --> 00:26:57,122
I love it.

392
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,201
I love being a mom.

393
00:27:00,401 --> 00:27:01,022
It's really fun.

394
00:27:01,522 --> 00:27:02,624
Um, they're so great.

395
00:27:02,824 --> 00:27:04,065
The boys are like amazing.

396
00:27:04,145 --> 00:27:06,668
And I have a very nice two boys.

397
00:27:08,831 --> 00:27:09,832
Yeah.

398
00:27:09,872 --> 00:27:11,854
That's uh, boys are out here.

399
00:27:11,914 --> 00:27:12,094
So.

400
00:27:16,298 --> 00:27:38,972
Yeah, no for sure chaotic chaotic my mom had like she only has us so I've got a brother that's older But now that I've gotten older and I have a lot of my friends have kids and I see how their boys are and just like dude like there's no way like my parents dealt with that No way because it is absolutely insane jumping off the things fighting all the time ran bunches just high energy and

401
00:27:39,372 --> 00:28:02,271
versus girls girls are like really chill like they may just be dramatic with each other but there's not the high energy always needing to fight something like oh that just never happens i know my house is covered in trucks and balls and like that's my interior decor now and they just like chase each other around thank god they have now each other to do that but they just chase each other around the dining room table

402
00:28:03,376 --> 00:28:12,659
with the trucks and then I like go to my best friend's place that has a girl and the girl like she says, she's just like, what do you like to join me at my teeth party?

403
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:17,720
Just like has like a tape tape, like a table set, how can I play?

404
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:20,361
Completely different energy.

405
00:28:22,241 --> 00:28:30,624
My boys are like jumping on her, like the second she comes up with and it's happening her and like her little girl's like, would you like to have a team party and break my hair?

406
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:38,961
No, probably all good things like just being a parent in general is probably like a great feeling.

407
00:28:38,981 --> 00:28:39,722
I don't know.

408
00:28:39,762 --> 00:28:44,464
I mean, maybe I still got a few more years left before it's like probably too late, but we'll see.

409
00:28:44,704 --> 00:28:45,124
We'll see.

410
00:28:45,264 --> 00:28:45,904
You're a guy.

411
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:51,666
You don't even have like, I know I could be like 60 from what they said, but I don't want you running to risk the all you get.

412
00:28:51,867 --> 00:28:52,567
And I don't know like,

413
00:28:52,987 --> 00:28:57,249
I'm already, I already feel old, so I feel like getting to waiting even longer.

414
00:28:57,369 --> 00:29:02,791
Like I think in like the 10 or 5 to 10 years, like when kids are like running around and doing all the activities, I'm gonna be exhausted.

415
00:29:02,811 --> 00:29:14,355
Like I'm already tired now, like from not having many responsibilities so I can imagine running around chasing kids all day is gonna be very physically demanding and the older I get, the less likely my body's gonna wanna support that, so.

416
00:29:14,735 --> 00:29:16,616
I don't know, like it's...

417
00:29:17,276 --> 00:29:33,493
I definitely have some like when I was in my early 20s I was just like dang like I don't think I'm ready to have kids yet like I'm gonna wait until I'm 30 not realizing like my body's kind of in a great position to deal with managing children and not like I wake up and like my knees will hard if I sleep the more hard way so

418
00:29:35,295 --> 00:29:46,269
Yeah, I didn't we didn't have kids until much later like I'm 40 so our kids are four and two Okay, I would not have given you that at all.

419
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:46,770
Definitely.

420
00:29:47,391 --> 00:29:48,813
Yeah, we're very good for each

421
00:29:49,619 --> 00:29:49,859
Thanks.

422
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:54,440
Yeah, but no, I'm definitely running around and doing all the things, but it's great.

423
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:54,880
They're great.

424
00:29:54,900 --> 00:30:00,102
You'll find, you find energy reserves in like your soul and your spirit and your heart.

425
00:30:00,142 --> 00:30:01,602
And then there's always like caffeine.

426
00:30:01,802 --> 00:30:06,444
So my friends have said you find a second gear or another gear you know existed.

427
00:30:06,524 --> 00:30:14,006
Yeah, like it just, it's something natural and you kicks in and you just kind of find the willpower to do it.

428
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:15,186
You know, everything to do.

429
00:30:15,506 --> 00:30:17,007
And it's just like you just know what to do.

430
00:30:17,027 --> 00:30:18,107
It's such a weird concept.

431
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:19,670
It's true.

432
00:30:20,991 --> 00:30:21,352
It's true.

433
00:30:22,672 --> 00:30:27,276
Well, I'm around and I'll be online tomorrow.

434
00:30:27,316 --> 00:30:29,497
Are you able to, this was no pressure.

435
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:31,939
We just thought it would be fun to do like a breathwork session.

436
00:30:31,979 --> 00:30:34,461
I've never done a breathwork, but hopefully you can join.

437
00:30:34,481 --> 00:30:36,182
Yep, I'll be on that one.

438
00:30:36,242 --> 00:30:36,782
I saw that email.

439
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:39,684
We just got kind of going through maybe what to expect.

440
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:44,087
I haven't read it, but it seems like a little intro and what to expect for tomorrow's call.

441
00:30:44,107 --> 00:30:45,668
So yeah, I'm curious.

442
00:30:45,728 --> 00:30:46,389
I think it'll be fun.

443
00:30:47,568 --> 00:30:47,828
Cool.

444
00:30:48,028 --> 00:30:48,269
Yeah.

445
00:30:48,309 --> 00:30:49,129
I'm excited.

446
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:50,291
We'll see then.

447
00:30:50,571 --> 00:30:53,233
I'm dropping up a message to Jake now.

448
00:30:53,373 --> 00:30:54,775
So we'll get that in motion.

449
00:30:54,795 --> 00:30:56,977
And we'll do it.

450
00:30:57,077 --> 00:30:59,819
It's just like early July, you know.

451
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:00,520
Yeah.

452
00:31:01,681 --> 00:31:02,022
All right.

453
00:31:02,042 --> 00:31:02,202
Cool.

454
00:31:02,242 --> 00:31:02,802
All right.

455
00:31:03,243 --> 00:31:04,484
Appreciate you.

456
00:31:04,504 --> 00:31:04,764
Bye.

457
00:31:05,245 --> 00:31:05,385
Bye.

458
00:31:05,445 --> 00:31:05,745
All right.

459
00:31:07,847 --> 00:31:08,027
Hey.

460
00:31:18,564 --> 00:31:19,925
Honestly, I don't know.

461
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:28,509
I mean, that should be something I oversee and like paying attention to a lot closer, but I'm just like, eh, I'm not trying to be like, you're talking about ads.

462
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:31,071
Hey, with agency doing it, that's fine.

463
00:31:31,091 --> 00:31:38,935
Me and other just fucking took over and did that shit like ASA and the Rocky bro, but like, I gotta wait on these niggas to like apply themselves.

464
00:31:51,737 --> 00:31:51,954
Thank you.

465
00:35:10,803 --> 00:35:16,386
I don't know how to do it.

466
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:19,268
20% of the time.

467
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,508
I can go get 20 bands.
