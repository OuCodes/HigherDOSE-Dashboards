1
00:01:57,548 --> 00:01:57,677
Thanks.

2
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:40,240
How's it going?

3
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:43,341
Awesome.

4
00:02:48,103 --> 00:02:48,443
How's it?

5
00:02:48,463 --> 00:02:49,244
Pleasure to meet you as well.

6
00:02:49,264 --> 00:02:50,264
How are you doing today?

7
00:02:50,664 --> 00:02:51,965
Oh, I have a double question.

8
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:52,805
Don't need to answer.

9
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:54,866
Appreciate you.

10
00:02:54,886 --> 00:02:55,827
Appreciate you doing.

11
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:56,587
Yeah.

12
00:03:06,592 --> 00:03:06,812
Okay.

13
00:03:09,561 --> 00:03:11,083
No, just me for today.

14
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:17,728
Okay.

15
00:03:22,653 --> 00:03:23,673
Yeah, let me show you as well.

16
00:03:24,314 --> 00:03:25,255
Are you in Tel Aviv as well?

17
00:03:36,063 --> 00:03:37,085
Uh, 10.33 in the morning.

18
00:03:37,105 --> 00:03:39,950
And I'm uh, central times on the US right now.

19
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:46,180
Uh, usually in San Diego, but right now I'm in Florida.

20
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,424
Um, yeah.

21
00:04:27,383 --> 00:04:27,944
Yep, no, 100%.

22
00:04:28,044 --> 00:04:28,404
Cool, cool.

23
00:04:54,904 --> 00:04:55,325
I did not.

24
00:04:55,605 --> 00:04:59,529
No, I'm fairly new to higher dose, joined on probably about six weeks ago now.

25
00:05:01,111 --> 00:05:04,855
So still, yeah, anything that is before then pre-18.

26
00:05:09,705 --> 00:05:12,367
a growth strategy at Haredos.

27
00:05:12,507 --> 00:05:16,370
So we've got an agency that manages the out-of-count Sharma Brands.

28
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:19,212
Maybe familiar with them.

29
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,174
They've handled a few bigger counts.

30
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:26,618
But yeah, so I'm also the Sharma Brands.

31
00:05:27,818 --> 00:05:31,321
Like Nick Sharma, he's got a podcast, pretty big in e-commerce space.

32
00:05:33,343 --> 00:05:47,255
But yeah, so I'm pretty much the liaison between the agency vendors and our marketing and sales channels with the internal team and reporting directly to the CMO.

33
00:05:47,975 --> 00:05:50,337
She brought me on the kind of head up those partnerships.

34
00:05:50,377 --> 00:05:54,361
So we can ensure that all of our vendors are meeting the KPIs we need.

35
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:58,404
And so we can continue to grow year over year.

36
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:00,266
So it's got to been my big focus.

37
00:07:15,217 --> 00:07:16,118
Hey, what's with me tonight?

38
00:07:16,138 --> 00:07:16,478
How you doing?

39
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:19,760
No worries.

40
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,740
Totally understand.

41
00:07:20,881 --> 00:07:21,681
Yeah, I know how it goes.

42
00:07:26,424 --> 00:07:28,265
Yeah, yeah, yep, just like a regular.

43
00:07:28,425 --> 00:07:28,605
Yeah.

44
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:42,416
Thank you.

45
00:10:00,776 --> 00:10:05,934
Oh.

46
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:04,950
Cool.

47
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:05,790
Yeah.

48
00:11:07,412 --> 00:11:07,952
Yep, for sure.

49
00:11:07,992 --> 00:11:08,953
Totally make sense.

50
00:11:09,874 --> 00:11:23,105
Now my first photo either worked with the handful of, I guess, Facebook reps at this level to help understand and direct the business to get to the next level of next tier Facebook considers and just grow on the channel.

51
00:11:23,205 --> 00:11:26,928
So as far as important people to know, Ingrid, she is a CMO, a higher dose.

52
00:11:27,248 --> 00:11:33,073
That would probably be the next point of contact to have on these calls or be grouped in.

53
00:11:33,113 --> 00:11:38,517
Her availability is scarce so she does have a pretty busy calendar and it is harder to sync up with her.

54
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:47,845
So that's kind of where I come in for a lot of this intermediary communication connecting with dots making sure all the vendors or partners are communicated connected and how the resources they need.

55
00:11:48,386 --> 00:11:52,229
But outside of her I would say Sharma Brands, the account manager on Meta,

56
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,761
probably some of their growth leads and some of the other resources they have.

57
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:08,747
So probably probably three or four more people on ongoing communication between the two parties that would be important to have on this communication report, which I think may have started that way.

58
00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:13,129
I think I got added to an email chain to sync up with you guys in the first place.

59
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:17,071
So yeah, I think a lot of the parties may be already involved.

60
00:12:18,651 --> 00:12:19,492
Yeah, six weeks ago.

61
00:12:21,353 --> 00:12:21,953
Yeah, yeah.

62
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:26,770
No, no, no, no.

63
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:33,913
And that's may have been communicating with and they're probably just putting me in, yep, you know, just kind of getting me in the mix with you guys to start.

64
00:12:34,793 --> 00:12:40,775
But as far as like the business direction, what we're kind of focused on this year has been a huge emphasis on top of formal growth.

65
00:12:41,856 --> 00:12:47,078
We have noticed a consolidation of like not new reach and just the ability to reach new people.

66
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:49,659
So we want to expand beyond the markets we've already touched.

67
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:51,300
The brands have been around for a handful of years.

68
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,501
They're a decade plus at this point.

69
00:12:53,601 --> 00:12:56,043
So there's been a market saturation there.

70
00:12:56,103 --> 00:13:03,346
So they're just looking to make more and new people aware about the products and what they have to offer, looking to expand in other channels like CTV and OTT.

71
00:13:03,787 --> 00:13:08,409
Also recently expanded in a half-loven, kind of just what most DC brands are pushing for.

72
00:13:08,869 --> 00:13:15,532
In 2025 it seems so just looking for other opportunities to expand the ecosystem so that it makes more channels like Meta effective.

73
00:13:16,012 --> 00:13:21,674
One thing we've noticed here every year is that Meta isn't as is in performing as strongly as it has for the brand previously.

74
00:13:21,694 --> 00:13:26,476
Noticing some pullback so we shift the spend around Google's kind of our primary channel at this point.

75
00:13:26,896 --> 00:13:28,537
I think mother definitely can be dominant.

76
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:33,339
It just needs the right assets and resources, which we haven't probably been providing.

77
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,841
There's, you know, some Confederate issues that need to be addressed.

78
00:13:37,281 --> 00:13:48,187
I think the creative does get optimized and fluctuated frequently, but there may not be enough diversity and creative assets, may not be enough static images in the mix, different types of video assets.

79
00:13:58,294 --> 00:13:58,494
Yep.

80
00:14:01,016 --> 00:14:05,199
Uh, not, no, yep, media creatives and across multiple channels.

81
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,102
Uh, email retention as well, but they don't touch the website.

82
00:14:09,242 --> 00:14:11,084
And we've got another partner for that.

83
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:20,931
You fun?

84
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:22,953
Um,

85
00:14:24,923 --> 00:14:29,306
So I feel like meta specifically, know that I think that's pretty encompassing.

86
00:14:30,226 --> 00:14:33,688
We're introducing an MM tool here in the next few weeks.

87
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:38,651
So that should be helpful in figuring out which of these channels are most impactful and incremental.

88
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:51,959
And we may be able to invest more in the meta, but really the opportunity we're looking to unlock here is like NetNewReach, dropping your attack and prioritizing the products that are going to give us the most opportunity to scale efficiently.

89
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,110
Yeah.

90
00:14:55,410 --> 00:15:00,452
Yeah, I'm on a cack is looking worse year over year, which is causing us to bring the scale down.

91
00:15:06,754 --> 00:15:07,675
Still bad, yes.

92
00:15:08,395 --> 00:15:08,515
Yeah.

93
00:15:12,336 --> 00:15:16,399
Yep, Northmeam MTA tool.

94
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:18,700
Last click, conservative you.

95
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:28,547
Well, it clicks on the cruel basis, kind of as you're familiar with how the tool works, but last click, one day, attribution, I think, in more traditional terms.

96
00:15:36,091 --> 00:15:38,093
Yeah, yeah, good.

97
00:15:38,973 --> 00:15:39,394
Yep, yep.

98
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:49,394
for last click, yeah.

99
00:15:49,934 --> 00:15:51,155
Well, that's the general.

100
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:58,419
I would say Cruel's more just based off of when the event happens, or I mean, not in the event happens when the click happens.

101
00:15:58,919 --> 00:15:59,199
Yeah.

102
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,900
I guess, yeah, we'll make it last touch.

103
00:16:13,446 --> 00:16:13,566
Yep.

104
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:18,009
Yep.

105
00:16:38,314 --> 00:16:41,677
You know, we do have a few product releases on the way.

106
00:16:41,717 --> 00:16:50,806
We just dropped one last month that did fairly well with our existing audience and it's performing well on some paid channels also.

107
00:16:50,906 --> 00:16:53,848
So we're going to continue to drop products.

108
00:16:53,928 --> 00:16:59,934
But I would say like the most, you know, focal point is just reducing tack on the channel by touching that new eyeballs.

109
00:17:12,473 --> 00:17:18,258
The LTV model is considered, but it is more of a one-time purchase kind of brand, very high AOVs.

110
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:23,903
The almost, I think, is like a $500, $600 AOV last little month.

111
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:30,068
So, you know, very, very high, I guess, cost, very high cost to entry as well.

112
00:17:30,188 --> 00:17:33,231
So, we do have some subscription products that

113
00:17:34,151 --> 00:17:42,252
We've introduced they're not like a primary driver, but it is starting to become a focal point of the business, but it's historically been OTPs.

114
00:17:43,673 --> 00:17:44,713
It's been the focus, so yeah.

115
00:17:45,113 --> 00:18:00,496
Yep, you know, except CTV, I think that's probably the only channel that they're not managing.

116
00:18:00,516 --> 00:18:01,476
But yeah.

117
00:18:07,043 --> 00:18:08,685
I think I'm five, six months now.

118
00:18:09,627 --> 00:18:10,849
They came in earlier this year.

119
00:18:10,869 --> 00:18:12,431
Yeah, relatively new.

120
00:18:13,172 --> 00:18:16,217
Some probably marks around March and April's when they started working with higher dose.

121
00:18:43,376 --> 00:18:43,557
Yeah.

122
00:18:43,577 --> 00:18:45,529
I agree.

123
00:19:27,932 --> 00:19:28,872
Yep, make sense.

124
00:19:28,953 --> 00:19:34,315
I would say coming into the next call, I kind of have those key for insights ready to, you know, just workshop with Ingrid.

125
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:37,197
You know, that's probably going to be a big focal point for her.

126
00:19:37,257 --> 00:19:47,262
And so, you know, that would be a good starting point for her to come in is you guys kind of having some, you know, recapping H1 coming into Q4.

127
00:19:47,282 --> 00:19:48,803
It's some ideas.

128
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:49,863
Good introduction.

129
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:53,965
You know, now we've kind of got this little preliminary call out the way.

130
00:19:55,286 --> 00:19:55,386
Cool.

131
00:19:57,973 --> 00:19:58,713
Awesome.

132
00:20:07,338 --> 00:20:07,538
Okay.

133
00:20:32,004 --> 00:20:40,369
Yep, yep, nope, don't expect that, but yeah, just moving in that direction so that, yeah, yeah, for sure, yeah, cool.

134
00:20:43,151 --> 00:20:45,553
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, totally get it.

135
00:20:45,573 --> 00:20:46,313
I know you guys are busy.

136
00:20:59,427 --> 00:21:00,508
Yep, yep, yep.

137
00:21:01,228 --> 00:21:01,708
One big unit.

138
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:05,410
All right, sounds good.

139
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:06,651
Awesome.

140
00:21:08,211 --> 00:21:08,892
Okay, thank you.

141
00:21:08,972 --> 00:21:09,852
Appreciate the time, Gras.

142
00:21:10,752 --> 00:21:11,193
Enjoy your time.

143
00:21:11,413 --> 00:21:13,154
And don't pledge a meeting as well.

144
00:21:13,214 --> 00:21:13,434
Peace.

145
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:24,479
Yeah, like, I don't know why I haven't happened, but I got thrown into the mix lab, and I'm not a huge fan, but like, you know, like, you're doing a do-do-do-do-go.

146
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,460
Okay.

147
00:21:28,261 --> 00:21:29,090
So many calls man.
