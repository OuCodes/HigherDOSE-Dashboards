0:00 - Unidentified Speaker
Great bc.

0:00 - Elyse Fonseca
How far along are you?

0:01 - Daniela Batista
Oh my god. I'm, I will be 31 weeks tomorrow.

0:04 - Elyse Fonseca
Oh my gosh You ready for the bump reveal?

0:08 - Unidentified Speaker
Oh, yes, please.

0:09 - Elyse Fonseca
Oh my god. That is so cute It's a big one That's so cool, but you're still feeling well Yeah, yeah pretty good in a little bit of pain, but you know could be worse all things considered i'm, uh, I'm hanging in there for sure That's so cool. Shout if you need anything.

0:31 - Unidentified Speaker
Yes, we'll do. We'll do.

0:33 - Elyse Fonseca
Thank you so much. Hi, Jessica. Hi, Jourdan.

0:37 - Jessica Alcalde
Hi, everyone. Hi. Hey.

0:40 - Maria Jose Castro
Where are you, Jessica? Where are you? I'm at Lauren's upstate, actually.

0:46 - Jessica Alcalde
But I came downstairs because I feel like we're not ready to share this stuff with her yet so she won't be on the comments yet.

1:00 - Unidentified Speaker
Cool.

1:00 - Elyse Fonseca
I'm loving you in a little halter neck. Look at you.

1:06 - Daniela Batista
I know, got your shoes on.

1:09 - Jessica Alcalde
Well actually it's like a gross cut off t-shirt that I like stuck in my sports bra. We pull it off really well.

1:22 - Daniela Batista
You have to wear halter tops more often. Why is Jessica dressed up?

1:28 - Elyse Fonseca
I didn't get a memo.

1:30 - Daniela Batista
I know, right? I'm in my crusty sweatshirt.

1:34 - Jessica Alcalde
Oh my God, I'm like stinky, but I appreciate that.

1:39 - Daniela Batista
We can't smell you, so it's okay.

1:43 - Unidentified Speaker
Yeah, right?

1:44 - Jessica Alcalde
Nobody knows. Hi, Ingrid. Hi, Anastasia. Hi, Fiona. Hi, Maria. Everyone, Danny. Jourdan. Hey squad. Hi, hi.

1:53 - Ingrid Milman Cordy
How's everyone doing? All good.

1:55 - Unidentified Speaker
Great. Yeah.

1:56 - Ingrid Milman Cordy
I'm really excited to do this with you guys. And here I'll just, I made another one of those little launch Bible things that I think everyone found useful for the body sculptor. So continue to look at this ever-growing, living, breathing home for all things red light wrap, red light mat. Full body red light mat. Full body red light mat. I have it right on the cover at least. So that's what the official... So one quick thing that I don't know if this is too late, but the dash between full body, I was thinking we drop it on like marketing stuff. Do we have it as a dash on packaging? I think we do.

2:52 - Jessica Alcalde
We do, but I think also one thing that we can consider too is, actually, you know what? We might be able to change it.

3:02 - Ingrid Milman Cordy
We can reach out and find out. If we can, I just feel like it flows a little bit better. Yeah. It's my fault because I approved it too. Okay, cool. Of the world, we can always change it in the next printing. But yeah, just in writing it over and over again, I just feel like it's easier full body. Okay. So real quick, you'll all have access to this document in a moment. But in today's conversation, we'll be going through some pretty high level things. And mostly it will be the Jessica show where she goes through the education and the positioning and things like that. The second half of the deck, you'll notice is empty. And that's because that's for you all. To put in your respective plans. I also wanted to create, just based on some feedback from the body sculptor, an opportunity for everyone to brainstorm once you hear the education and the in-use situations for us to have the conversation of like, how do we want to talk about this? Well, obviously we won't like, you know, feed you to the fishes, like we'll tell you kind of like where it belongs in people's homes and lives and rituals. But then like we can kind of brainstorm here. Not everybody loves brainstorming in a group or like in real time. So if you have ideas that aren't captured here, feel free to just like add them into the deck afterwards. I'm not necessarily one that's great at like public brainstorming. So yeah, just both options are available to you. And then we also linked, Danny, thank you for linking that. All of the photography is already done here and ready for you to access. So there's been quite a lot of content filmed both in studio, video, and then there was a lifestyle shoot with Lauren. All of that should be in that Google Drive that is linked in the deck. Any questions before we dive into it?

5:03 - Jessica Alcalde
Okay, so one thing really quickly on some of the photography, we're still waiting on some edits from Kevin on the shoot from Lauren Upstate, but we'll make sure that that's really clear which ones are the final edited. And then if there's something you wanna use from unedited, please let us know. So it's not out there in the world, not perfect or the way we want it, but those should be coming, I think soon. Danny, I can't remember when exactly he said he would have them for us, but before he leaves on vacation, so. Yeah, I'll verify.

5:40 - Daniela Batista
He leaves on vacation on August, I think, so we have time, but I'll email him to see where we stand. Okay, great.

5:48 - Ingrid Milman Cordy
I think as an action item, though, is once you get through all of this, everyone should go in and look at all the photography. If there is something that you do want to use, you have the deadline of, like, Monday of next week to tell us that you want use a particular image if it's not already meant to be edited.

6:10 - Jessica Alcalde
Perfect. Thank you.

6:11 - Ingrid Milman Cordy
Yeah. Okay. I'll put that in the slide too, so it's clear when everyone's referencing it back. Okay. So shipping date for the full body red light mat is August 30th, which makes it reasonable to do a VIP email launch on August 17th and then put it live to the public on Tuesday, August 19th. Which means that we have to have the PDP and all of the collateral landed by that Friday. I think that ends up being like the 15th, because the 17th is a Sunday. Yeah. So August 15th is the deadline for everything. And then Fiona, I don't know if you need anything sooner, but I know we're not doing a particularly big like press push or anything like that. Would August 15th for PDP and collateral landing be adequate for you?

7:02 - Fiona Johanna
Yeah, I think we'll still want to give an exclusive to someone like an athletex. So if we can get it even a week out from when our live date is, that would be beneficial.

7:19 - Ingrid Milman Cordy
OK. So let me just put that in here. So what date would you want? It's a week out from our live date, so sorry.

7:30 - Fiona Johanna
when are we going live again?

7:33 - Ingrid Milman Cordy
The 17th for VIP and email folks and then the 19th to the public.

7:38 - Fiona Johanna
Great yeah I think if we're able to get it by the 11th of August that gives us a little bit of time to get ahead of the consumer push.

7:50 - Ingrid Milman Cordy
Okay and then it will also be included in our Labor Day sale which the dates are not all the way approved but very likely going to be August 27th for VIP and then it'll either end on the 2nd or 3rd of September. The actual Labor Day is the first this year and then last year it lasted for like nine days so I don't know how long we're going to be able to do that for or that it makes sense to do that for I should say. So it'll be yeah most likely the 27th to the 3rd and then and this product will be included in that so let me just add in you said the 11th? Yes. Yeah, and that can be like our final final, so we'll share preliminary rounds like way before then, so we just know, yeah.

8:42 - Jessica Alcalde
Yeah, we'll just work back from that date, Jessica.

8:48 - Ingrid Milman Cordy
Yeah. Okay, cool. All right, so off to Jessica to do the education and positioning. Is that cool? Yes. Okay, so this is our full body red light.

9:04 - Jessica Alcalde
I'm not sure, but I think most of you guys have seen at least some version of this in person. So the idea was that we, I think you guys had seen, we also tried to do the map version. So we did a couple of different reiterations of this. And really what we want to lean in on this one is so 90 milliwatts, irradiance, that's almost double our mask. So when you're laying directly on it, that's when you're going to get the 90 milliwatts. We're also waiting on the factory for some reason, it's taking them forever to give us a chart, like a distance chart. So if you're six inches away versus 12 versus 24, what's your irradiance there? And then at what point does it become more about circadian rhythm, mood, that kind of thing. So if you're hanging this in your room and you're leaving it on for an hour and you're going around your room doing a couple different things, you would lean in more to the mood benefits of that one. So you're kind of nightly ritual so that you're not disrupting your circadian rhythm with blue light basically so that's what we want to also include in this so you can see where your skin benefits are where your pain benefits are and then what's happening at those distances there is a 40 Hertz the near-infrared pulses at 40 Hertz so regardless of you know the time that you choose it's always for pulsing at 40 Hertz but you're really going to get the benefits of that pain relief with direct skin contact. So that's your goal. Um, you, you would use it like directly on you and 40 Hertz is known to, um, relieve pain. So that's also not something you have to worry about if you have epilepsy. So it's the light wave that you can't see. So it's pulsing, but you can't see it. Um, which is great. And then also it's coming with a handheld remote. So it has a handheld remote and then also a control panel, built in directly on this. So if you're laying on it, you can touch it. And then if you're away from it and you want to turn it back on, you can use your remote to click it and turn it back on. Great. Also stackable with our PEMF Pro. You can wrap it around you. You can hang it. You can roll it up. And it comes with similar to a yoga bag, where you can kind of roll it up and slide it into a yoga. It over your shoulder. But it is pretty tall.

11:51 - Elyse Fonseca
You said you can stack it on top of the pimp mat?

11:56 - Jessica Alcalde
Yes, you can. If you're using your pimp mat, you're fine. I wouldn't necessarily walk away from your pimp mat on like the highest level on top of it. But you can lay on your pimp mat and then put the red light on top of you, which is a really great kind of step stackable thing. So. Oh, okay.

12:17 - Elyse Fonseca
So you put the mat on top of you versus. Yeah.

12:21 - Jessica Alcalde
So while you're laying on the mat on your PEMF mat, you can kind of stack this and we do have imagery to support that. So that will help you kind of convey that message. And we'll get language around that where it's like stackable with your PEMF. So the idea is that you can, this is full body red light. You can lay on it, you can lay under it, you can hang it, or you can wrap it you and you can also use this on your bed you can use this on the couch this is like a really flexible amazing full-body red light that you can do a lot with and it's pretty wide so when we say you like wrap like you can get a pretty good wrap with it was it tested on someone with the highest heat are you talking about the pimp yeah I'm just checking it hasn't been tested on the highest heat if it's just like if someone's just lying and it's touching on the pimp.

13:15 - Ingrid Milman Cordy
I'm only saying this because that's my- It's not touching on the pimp, though.

13:18 - Jessica Alcalde
You're in between the pimp and the- Yeah, so you wouldn't, again, want to do that for an eight-hour session, but you're fine for 60 minutes, which is the length of the longest time that the- And if you were in between it, then the Tune Max wouldn't really touch- It would still touch because it's wide enough.

13:34 - Anastasia Jenkin
That's the only reason why.

13:35 - Elyse Fonseca
I'm just saying because I'm yellow and my plugs aren't, so I just wanted to make sure we've pissed them.

13:41 - Jessica Alcalde
Yeah, for sure. I mean, again, I wouldn't recommend doing this for like a really, really long time or walking away and leaving that product, like leaving the PEMF mat on, but we will convey that too. Like it's stackable with the PEMF, but again, like this is an electric product. Like you don't leave an electric blanket, like, you know what I mean? Like we have to exercise.

14:09 - Anastasia Jenkin
Okay. Yeah, for sure.

14:10 - Jessica Alcalde
So Fiona, to your question, yeah, we're working with the factory to get an irradiance chart so that you know what irradiance you're actually getting at the distance. And I think like the best positioning for it because, you know, standing in front of a panel for 20 minutes might be fine, but I think if you're doing like a meditation practice, but I think most people, if they're going to leave it on 60 minutes while it hanging, we would lean into the mood and circadian rhythm benefits rather than the skin benefits or the pain relief benefits for that one. For sure. Yeah.

14:47 - Fiona Johanna
I know Sephora asked that question, and it's, I think, really important for us to be at the forefront of educating so people don't think that the product's not working for them if they're using it, but then they're standing 10 feet away from it. So I think you didn't even look at that.

15:06 - Jessica Alcalde
like content education around like look if you're gonna hang it um here's all the ways that we recommend working with hanging versus laying on it um so we're in the content storytelling but it would be really helpful to have that chart from the factory yeah so we'll have that chart and then there is also a slide here on like use case the nate thank you so much Ingrid for helping me get that in there um and then from that we will also take the one like these are really good questions for us so that we know when we're going to do the PDP graphics that we're conveying like the right information. So, you know, we'll talk about pain relief and that kind of thing. We'll show images of people laying on it or laying under it versus like mood benefits. It'll be more of like the ambient light situations. Also, the time if you're laying relying on it does increase the benefit that you're getting. For example, like if you're and we'll add this back in. I think we were worried about confusing people with too many benefits of like when and why to use it. But like if you're using it for 20 to 30 minutes, that's when you start to trigger ATP production 40 to 60 minutes. That's more like deep restorative and pain relief. And the irradiance is like mild enough, strong enough that you're getting pain relief. You're also getting skin benefits, but again, this is like such a full body thing. Even with the red light panels, I feel like, you know, those things take so much time to see like real long benefits that pain relief and recovery and mood are the ones that people see first. Yeah.

16:52 - Ingrid Milman Cordy
I think those types of benefits and the timing for them work really nicely for like social an email in particular, because I think you can kind of create cards around like, here's what happens in 20 minutes. Here's what happens in 30 minutes. And it's like its own, like that time bound messaging story is kind of its own little content piece where I wouldn't necessarily share it with all the other benefits at once. So yeah, I actually had that in here, like in the original deck.

17:21 - Jessica Alcalde
And I think Lauren was like, I think this is going to confuse people. So we just moved it do wall hanging benefits versus direct skin contact benefits. So you guys can let us know. We can include that other information as like what you're saying, Ingrid, for email slash so forth.

17:39 - Ingrid Milman Cordy
I would always default to putting all of the information in here and let the market team slice and dice.

17:46 - Jessica Alcalde
OK, great. Yeah, we can put that back in for sure.

17:50 - Fiona Johanna
And how we have clinical studies to showcase the benefits if they have some substantiated results that show like 30 minutes versus 60 minutes, I think that's really important too, just to have some like backing to these claims. And I know that those PubMed studies do really well on social as well.

18:11 - Jessica Alcalde
Okay, that's good to know. We actually do have some studies and we'll, we'll add those into the resource hub also. But then we were, we're still gathering, so we're trying to get as many as we can that show what happens with longer lengths of time and why, basically. But yeah, we'll definitely get a clinical page slash updated on there. But I think we already have like three or four that we're trying to comb through and pull out all the data that directly speak to longer times. And I think most of them, though, are around food and pain relief. So it would depend on, you know, if you're laying on it or if you're hanging it, for example. Awesome. Yeah, that would work.

19:00 - Fiona Johanna
All right.

19:01 - Ingrid Milman Cordy
I'm going to just cause we only have 10 minutes left. Sorry guys.

19:05 - Jessica Alcalde
I want everyone to hear it.

19:07 - Ingrid Milman Cordy
And then, um, so just really quickly, we're going to go through the extended session times and what that means. Then direct skin contact. This is just going deeper into a lot of what you've already kind of went through at the high level, so I think that's good. And then, yeah, hanging wall benefits. And then Jessica will add in the competitive analysis, just so you have that in your back pocket. And then we'll get into the in-use situation. So I really want to make sure we get here, because this is going to be like the meat of what the marketing team goes off and does in their brainstorming. But let's go back really quickly into this here, if we missed anything already.

19:44 - Jessica Alcalde
So one thing that we wanted to talk about, and this goes into the competitive too, is that most people with this kind of product, because spec wise, you know, we're not necessarily crazy innovative. Like we decided not to do the matte one with the like custom bulbs and all of that, because like when we did do the sort of small consumer group, most people preferred this one. So when it came to like a favorite, actually everyone liked the wrap. It was like easier to carry around. People understood this. It required very little education. They could lay on it. They could drag it to a different room. It was just easier. So we decided to move forward with this one. And our biggest positioning and I think our competitive edge will be more on how we speak to our audience about it and more around the nervous system and the helping with burnout rather than recovery, skin, all of that, which of course you are getting those benefits, but what people aren't leaning into is like the serotonin and endorphins, like the dose part that you get, um, the lowering your cortisol and like the, what happens when you are supporting circadian rhythm. So rather than it being this, like necessarily, you know, it's like the softer way, basically, how do you ritualize this red light into your kind of daily life. And then it'll also talk about, we'll talk about that more, like what those benefits are in the use case scenarios. So the benefits for the extended time are like full body and mind reset, lowering cortisol, releasing feel good chemicals, encouraging circadian rhythm balance for more restful sleep, which also leads to better recovery, better skin, et cetera. And then the longer you're sessions are, you're promoting more rest and digest, et cetera, which is a huge thing that we always do. And then the 90 milliwatts. So one thing I wanted to comment about this too is that our mat is zero EMFs because we are in this kind of medium range, which allows us to do longer, safer, extended sessions and keep us EMF free. So of course we're going to test positive for EMFs at the plug site but anything that's touching your body will have zero emfs and we'll get a zero emf and we'll get videos well we have videos from our factory but maybe we can have them do something a little more official or we can film something like ourselves to kind of show that it is zero emf that's sick yeah and I think um definitely for us to film something for that because I think customers as a customer service would eat that shit up. Yeah, for sure. So of course, skin benefits include everything that like our, you know, we know about red light. So skin rejuvenation, deep muscle recovery, um, enhanced energy production. So you are feeding the mitochondria of yourselves every time you're laying on this and then, you know, stimulating collagen production, reducing inflammation, supporting circadian and nitric oxide activity, because you're increasing your circulation, so you're increasing nitric oxide. So there's a lot of stuff that the traditional red light is providing, but we're just now doing it in this full body direct skin contact way. And you will see that kind of healthy glow. I just think that when it comes to our face, we tend to take, we exfoliate that space more, or your face more, so your skin responds better. You're somebody who's not like fully exfoliating your body. You might not see that immediate, like immediate glow on your whole body right away, but I do think you actually do see that. So the more naked you are, you're going to see that on, on this too. And then of course the 40 Hertz is really helping to support your, um, pain relief stuff and lowering inflammation. And we do have clinical trials on that as well. So this will get warm. You can, so you can, did you say warm? I'm sorry. Like hot. Yeah, but not crazy. Like it's pretty minimal. Like it's similar to our mask. Similar to the face mask.

24:11 - Elyse Fonseca
Yeah.

24:12 - Jessica Alcalde
And also because the Hertz is pulsing, um, because the near infrared is pulsing that actually mitigate some of the heat. Okay, cool.

24:20 - Fiona Johanna
Just sorry if I'm jumping ahead, but I know we don't have a lot of time. I'm curious because there's so many, rabbit holes of like benefits to go down if you had to like logline what this product is good for would you say like longevity and recovery would be two halo terms that we could position and you know use as a hook or would it be like burnout mitigation as some of you know the entry point language that we could start to market?

24:51 - Jessica Alcalde
Well I think you guys I mean what's the most compelling really to you guys tell me and then we can lean in more on education for that too.

25:01 - Fiona Johanna
I mean burnout is really interesting to me like thinking about how this differentiates from the PEMF mat and like why someone would buy it I actually feel like the fact that you're getting energy from this for me at least like burnout is something that I feel most Millennials and Gen Z go through but then if we're targeting more fitness I could just see like recovery and longevity being really great Keywords that then we can go into the weeds of like pain management circadian rhythm sleep To the in situation I Think we can decide I don't know if we need to marry one halo message I think there's gonna be similar to the body sculptor where like

25:50 - Ingrid Milman Cordy
there's a recovery halo message There's a bit of a cosmetic halo message. There's a fascia one. So like, I think the power of all of the different channels working in different ways is helpful. The whole idea though, I do think that like recovery, longevity and burnout all are not that just like different from each other. And I think you can go deeper into each one of them. And I think that's the right approach.

26:21 - Fiona Johanna
Yeah, I don't think we've spoken much about burnout before. So that's why I feel really excited about this as an entry point on that conversation. Yeah.

26:31 - Jessica Alcalde
Well, so here's a couple of different ways that we think would be really great to use it. We also have imagery to support all of these scenarios, except for the work from home office. So that will be one that we can do in a future shoot. Also, we have home gyms, sort of, but we really have more exercise. So basically, create your meditation area. So your meditations are now red light activated. So it's an opportunity for you to not only build, if you don't already have one, a meditation practice while you're getting your red light, which is something we've done for the mask, but I think now this is another even greater a great way to do it for full body. So mood boosting, creating a vibe and like kind of ritualizing that time for yourself, improving your home gym. So your workouts are now readily activated and you can like build in recovery into your workout. So whether it's like hanging and you're like coming and going back to it between sessions or you've got it laid out, and then not only are you creating a vibe in your gym, but you can also go and lay on top of it or stand in front of it to stack that ritual of working out and recovery. Morning and evening rituals, especially if you wake up before the sun rises and you don't want to have intense blue light blasting in your eyes and disrupting that circadian rhythm, you're getting a more gentle wake-up approach and also kind of easing yourself into the day and then also evening rituals. So like a couple hours before bed or an hour before bed you're switching off blue lights and turning on your red light because this will fill the room so you have like this beautiful vibe to transition into like a calmer natural sleeping space. And then direct skin contact will give you pain relief and So you can stack it on the mat, you can lay on the couch, you can also like lay in bed with it. So this again could also go into your kind of evening ritual. If you're like trying to transition into rest and digest, you're stacking it with your pimp mat or laying in bed, you can Read, whatever. And then another one, and this is kind of more for like maybe the male biohackers, like improving your mitochondrial function effortlessly. I feel like men who buy like that kind of language, and then supporting recovery after intense workouts, and then ritualized light while you're working, hanging in in your work from home office. I'm sure you guys have seen mine hanging in some of my meetings, even though I moved my desk out of that room, but still it was there. Set the mood, so hanging in the bedroom for like intimate moments, and then integrating it into everyday wellness practices like stretching, yoga, that kind of thing. I don't know if you guys have had a chance to look at some of the imagery that we got, but there's really beautiful photos there. And there's also some really cute ones of like Lauren with her family too. So it's kind of like an easy thing for like the whole fam to kind of use. So yeah, those are the kind of like use case scenarios that help to kind of effortlessly add this into into your space and in your life, because basically you just have to lay there or you just have to turn it on and then you can get all these benefits. And of course, like, you know, the beauty benefits, really, you're gonna get the most from that when you're directly laying on it, but you'll have like secondary benefits when you hang it in your room.

30:29 - Unidentified Speaker
Ingrid?

30:29 - Ingrid Milman Cordy
Not a question more, just I have to run because I have a hard stop, I think just as next steps, I'm just blank. If you guys want to keep going, I'll send the deck out to everyone. Please, now is the time for everyone on this call to review the deck. You'll notice that there are slots. There's also more. There's some messaging hierarchies and things like that. There's links to the photography. It's in the comments, so you can't see it here. Then this is where all of your ideas, content needs, all of that gets put in. So what I'll do is I'll set a meeting up for a full hour at the end of next week to have you all, similar to what we did previously with the body sculptor, take all of this information into account and give us your plans for communications in your respective channels.

31:25 - Jessica Alcalde
So if everybody does have more time, I can do the screen sharing and we can kind of talk through some ideas because I think like hearing what resonates with you guys the most as far as the positioning then I can help flesh out some of the education parts more if you feel like there's something we're missing or whatever.

31:44 - Ingrid Milman Cordy
Here's the link to the document. Everyone now will have it and have editorial access to it and then I'll set up another meeting for next week. Sorry about that I thought 30 minutes was enough but that was silly of me. Me. Thanks for everything. Bye. This is so much good info, Jessica.

32:02 - Unidentified Speaker
It's like we need like two hours.

32:05 - Elyse Fonseca
Come on. Well, so question.

32:08 - Jessica Alcalde
I mean, in hearing these in use to off like in use situations, is there something else that you guys are thinking of Is there something you want to see more in the education? Because I feel like then it will help with like the messaging hierarchy like what resonates the most when you're thinking of like why someone would buy this. Or maybe that's just it the versatility of it is a great but Fiona I feel like,

32:43 - Fiona Johanna
I think it's like great to have a choose your own adventure like wellness your way you know have it on direct to skin, use it in your recovery room, use it for your daily rituals. I feel like that's one angle that's just talking about the functionality of how to use it. But I still feel like sometimes we have so, I think it's really important to have like what is the reason why you want to buy it. And while there's different funnels that on different channels we can speak to beauty versus recovery versus longevity, there's still, like, an announcement of the product and, like, what's the tagline of it and, like, how do we want to say it. So, I mean, for me, I think the burnout and longevity and the fact that this is energizing your skills is different than, you know, any of the other full-body products, like the Pumped Fat. So I would just love to see, like, any data, whether it's consumer or, Yeah, if we have like clinical studies that can back that, that this is going to energize your system and help with overall burnout recovery and longevity mitigation, I think that could be something that we dig into as like a primary benefit before going into all of these secondary benefits.

34:10 - Jessica Alcalde
And then simple question, how do we hang this? Cause I don't think I, your sample doesn't have the hooks so because we originally had the mat one is the one that you could hang we switched it and so we added the hooks so let me actually go now this one has these hooks here so what you will get when you get get your set is it will come with hooks that can go over your door but you have to have like a pretty big home like I wouldn't be able to hang this on my door for example but some people's doors would accommodate for this. You'll also get wall hooks that you can drill in and also like sticky wall hooks so depending on like how lazy or how like much you're committed to hanging it somewhere you'll have like a whole like hanging kit that comes with this.

35:11 - Fiona Johanna
Cool.

35:12 - Unidentified Speaker
Yeah.

35:12 - Jessica Alcalde
What you can use or not use, I think I'll be curious to see what most people end up doing with theirs. Because I think, Anastasia, you guys used yours as like a blanket for pretty much the whole time, right? Yeah, we basically just made it a bed.

35:28 - Anastasia Jenkin
Yeah. And like have it as a bed. But I don't have the hooks on mine. So I would totally have that hung up. But even now, I'm starting to think more and more. It's just reminders, right? So now I like I am gonna bring it out and use it as a blanket and just start taking advantage of that.

35:49 - Jessica Alcalde
Yeah, for sure. And then another thing we can talk about with competitive edge too is that, you know, of course it's medical grade silicone, third party tested. We make sure that, you know, it's zero EMF. And that was part of the reason of like what determined the strength and the power that we wanted to use, pulsing the Hertz, for pain, and also simplifying it. So I think one thing that our product does is it's just really easy. You don't have to learn how to use the remote. It's like an iPhone. It's just on 20, 40, 30, you know, whatever time you want to do, you can just punch it. Sorry, excuse me.

36:36 - Fiona Johanna
Yeah, I mean, I think I think this is going to be great. I feel like, Anastasia, maybe between you and I, we can take a look at what talent can give us the competitive edge, because I know it's not incredibly different from some of the other units in the market. So having someone credible speak to the efficacy and the fitness recovery, that might be an important differentiator.

37:02 - Jessica Alcalde
So one thing I do want to point out too that since we first started making this product, a lot of them have come out on the market, that what we need to do is, because I think our competitive now feels a little dated, is look at the materials, the construction, and what those companies have done to create a product that's actually delivering safe and effective red light, so we can lean into are kind of materials and safety in that way too. There's also like people, there's the people who are diehard higher doses, right?

37:42 - Anastasia Jenkin
So it's like, those are the people that are going to buy it because they just trust higher dose and they want to buy it from us because they know us. I think it'd be interesting to look at the difference in the prices. And we know there's three, we know one charge and then the other one, even Trina, who we're doing this body sculpt video, she just posted one from another Brand, I can't remember.

38:05 - Jessica Alcalde
Well, you said it to me actually when you okay amazing Instagram Self or just Well, so Samish said $14.99 and I think that's because of the tariffs Situation, but I'm gonna double check with him because I think that's a tough sell Yeah for the current market that we are now and so we're really gonna be testing like how this product performs because I think And this is light, right?

38:33 - Elyse Fonseca
Very light.

38:34 - Jessica Alcalde
Yeah, it's a pretty lightweight thing. Easy. So I was like dragging two of them around plus something else like it's a camera. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty light. The only thing is, is it's very tall. So when we say wrap, like it's pretty big. So that would be my only concern with regards to the price is like if the PEMF mat that's as hell.

39:00 - Elyse Fonseca
And like, we, we, you know, highlight the 40 pounds, the 20 pounds of crystals, etc, blah, blah, you know, like, and that's 1300. If you want to sell this for 1500, I feel like it might be a hard sell.

39:16 - Jessica Alcalde
Yeah, so Samisha actually put that price into a group chat today and still haven't had a chance to get it. But I'm hoping we can get it lower or we price price it in a way that it's sold during sales, if that makes sense. But still, it would have to be pretty deep discount, I think.

39:38 - Elyse Fonseca
How much does it cost to make?

39:40 - Jessica Alcalde
Well, it's not a cheap product to make. That's the other thing, is that there are so many lights in there, and also the pulsing, and we're including the hanging kit, and also a bag. So it's not exactly a cheaper price point. But one thing I will say about it, and I think, Anastasia, you had a chance to open the bond charge one when I was at Lawrence, and it smelled so bad. Yeah, it smelled bad, and it is a bit of a weird... It's really, really heavy. Yeah, it was incredibly heavy and stinky and difficult to store.

40:20 - Anastasia Jenkin
And they do sell this as a bed, too, which is not a bad thing either, because it is the badness, but we are about how it's stacking. We are focusing on people who have to get things done. We're looking at what the market is.

40:35 - Jessica Alcalde
It's like mom's on the go.

40:36 - Anastasia Jenkin
One of the biggest things, and I know a lot of when initially when we're having this conversation was hanging it on the shower while people shower. Obviously we're going to be making them a red light shower, but that was something that people were really interested in. But I guess it comes into play of like, how far away it can be.

40:55 - Jessica Alcalde
Yeah, I think when you're hanging it, unless you're standing in front of it or meditating in front of it, if you're doing it for the longer times, to have it more for the mood stuff. Because yeah, I think the chart, I mean, it's not that you aren't getting red light benefits, but that might not be your main driver if you're going to have it just lighting the room and be beautiful. Yeah.

41:19 - Anastasia Jenkin
like on your shower door while you're showering.

41:23 - Jessica Alcalde
Yeah. Not like huge. I think it's too, I think it would be too intense for that. Yeah. And also, I mean, I don't know, I guess if you had like a huge bathroom, but for my, I just know my bathroom, which is like basically a dog house in Brooklyn. It's like too intense for that space.

41:49 - Anastasia Jenkin
Yeah, I know Gary Breka was interested in this, so we are going to send him one and so he would be interesting to see. He wants to try and push it out. Great.

42:00 - Elyse Fonseca
I mean, Jessica, I added Thila to this call a little bit late just as we were getting into it because I was like, oh shit, this is lots of good info, like Thila should join. Could you go back to the info that we're getting from the factory about distance?

42:17 - Jessica Alcalde
Yes, so what we have asked the factory to do is create an irradiance chart that shows you so when I can tell you that direct skin contact gives you the 90 milliwatts, which is like almost double the red light mask. So that would be for your whole body. And yeah, basically, you're getting full body red light double the red light mask. Which is also great for pain. It puts us in that pain relief zone along with the 40 Hertz pulse. And then, you know, let's say you're six inches away, you might cut that into half, for example, and then you would be around the red light mask range. And we can even have like maybe mask, like now you're at red light mask range or whatever. But I think, yeah, we're going to show a distance chart that shows what your skin benefits are depending on how far you are. So for example, if you're sitting in front of it and you're about 12 inches away because you're meditating, you'll know what kind of red light you're going to get on that too. Sick.

43:21 - Elyse Fonseca
And you said that about the time usage too, right? That we'll get info on like, Yeah.

43:26 - Jessica Alcalde
So I technically already have the time info, like what happens around 20 minutes, what happens around 40 minutes, what, you know what I mean? So I can provide that already. I'll draw, I'll drop that in for you guys. So I think like 20 minutes would be quick and energizing daily maintenance. You know, 30 to 40 minutes would be like a pain relief section. And then like 60 minutes would be like a, you know, a deep restorative, deep restorative kind of recovery. And then also great for your morning and evening rituals. If you want to like start your day, like, Oh, I'm committing to my first hour, no blue light. So you can have it on for And then it's timing it for itself. So you just know, I think that would actually be a really good content piece. Like I'm not doing blue light for the first hour and the last hour of my day. Love that. Yeah.

44:25 - Unidentified Speaker
Okay.

44:25 - Elyse Fonseca
Oh my God. So much info. I'm like, Holy crap. Hold on.

44:30 - Jessica Alcalde
That's funny because we cut out like a ton of it. So you guys are interesting. It in.

44:37 - Elyse Fonseca
Yeah, back in that would be so helpful.

44:40 - Jessica Alcalde
Yeah, so we'll flesh it out again, like a little bit more thoroughly the way we have the body sculptor one where not all the editing, like not all the EDU information made it to the marketing deck, but there'll be something else. And then when we do customer service, and then a team education, we'll keep all that stuff in there. Okay, cool. Love that.

45:03 - Jessica Alcalde
Awesome. Well, does anyone else have any questions?

45:07 - Elyse Fonseca
So do we also, so assuming, okay, all right, hold on. Here I go. Glow serum. Oh yeah, totally. Is that like all over your body basically then?

45:20 - Jessica Alcalde
I mean you could, it would be like super expensive. We actually do have like a body glow serum in development. And we just kind of paused on it because we weren't like super in love with it But I think we will revisit that because it is a great thing to kind of include. Yeah Yeah, like a full body serum where you're getting red light benefits, but you're also nourishing your your whole body so I have that from necessary the Inspiration for us to because it goes on quickly it dries quickly, no residue, and it would be a perfect match with that. Yeah, easy add-on. Yeah, for sure.

46:14 - Elyse Fonseca
Awesome. Cool. I'm into it. Yeah. Anyone else?

46:20 - Anastasia Jenkin
I'm sure there will be more, and I am Once we do launch, well, I guess we're planning to do another webinar. As long as it's, it's, I mean, if Anthony knows this, he can lead, or if you want to leave the plan, I'll know more and dates kind of once we finalize all of this, but it'll probably be beginning of September.

46:48 - Jessica Alcalde
Again, maybe right before Labor Day sale.

46:51 - Anastasia Jenkin
So we get them to push.

46:53 - Jessica Alcalde
Yeah. Yeah. Course, no problem. And then I think also, what would be helpful, because I feel like the affiliate group is very well educated on red light. If they submit their questions before that would even be helpful, because we can make sure that we're like super locked and prepared. Because I do think people ask about competitive edge and pricing and that kind of thing. And we can figure out where and tell you know what I mean, we'll just really locked in. Or maybe if we could even just talk to a few affiliates first to get their kind of Read and take on it.

47:31 - Anastasia Jenkin
Well, I mean, we did like we did with the body sculptor tool with the last webinar. Well, actually, it was with the first one with Anthony. We did say, send in your questions. And they did send in a lot of questions before, and we made sure that we got them covered. So for this one, we will already have been launched. That's good. Yeah. We can already in, even in the email that I send to affiliates, we'll have like education. We'll take what you've sent now and kind of put it together in a whole educational format and then we'll say, Hey, we're doing a webinar and we'll have the type form and then we'll have the options that they can add in their questions and then we can take it from there. Great. Okay. Amazing.

48:16 - Jessica Alcalde
Great, okay. I'm doing like a hundred things at the same time, so I'm gonna have to jump off for this.

48:23 - Anastasia Jenkin
Oh yeah, okay, no problem guys.

48:26 - Jessica Alcalde
Well, just email me also if you have other questions you want, and then, yeah, I guess we'll all connect again next week and then we'll have some other stuff in here too.

48:37 - Anastasia Jenkin
Thank you so much, Jessica, this was very helpful. Thank you.

48:41 - Jessica Alcalde
Yeah, I actually think this was like pleasantly supportive.

48:45 - Anastasia Jenkin
Yeah.

48:45 - Jessica Alcalde
Yeah, I do think everyone wants full body red light. Everyone wants to glow. Jessica, do you know how many we're ordering for the first round?

48:54 - Elyse Fonseca
I think it's pretty small.

48:56 - Jessica Alcalde
Let me find out. I want to say like 500. Okay. So not a huge one just to kind of test because we are doing a pretty soft launch and we do really want to lean into the red light shower head when that one goes. So, I think that one is the one that we're going to be going hard on. Okay. Love that.

49:22 - Elyse Fonseca
Yeah. Oh, I'm excited.

49:24 - Jessica Alcalde
You got me. I feel like I've been looking at this thing for two years.

49:31 - Anastasia Jenkin
Why don't you video yourself giving birth with the red light mask? Right.

49:38 - Jessica Alcalde
Could you imagine?

49:39 - Anastasia Jenkin
world just make a real have it on just be like this is how you stayed calm we do screaming just focused POV my child's into my red light hospital room.

49:55 - Jessica Alcalde
Get all the angles.

49:57 - Anastasia Jenkin
Yeah, get all the angles. Do it for the team, come on.

50:02 - Jessica Alcalde
Just kidding.

50:03 - Anastasia Jenkin
Come on! Yeah, that's a great idea.

50:07 - Unidentified Speaker
I can't wait to post that.
