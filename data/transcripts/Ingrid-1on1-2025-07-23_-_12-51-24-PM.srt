1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:06,501
but now the problem is every tool does a little bit of everything and so that's what causes all the confusion.

2
00:00:06,541 --> 00:00:07,704
I'm sure you've experienced that.

3
00:00:07,844 --> 00:00:10,028
So basically

4
00:00:11,324 --> 00:00:27,798
Bark is meant to be a like business intelligence tool for us able to understand overall what our media is doing based on our profitability and you know, like that whole thing, right?

5
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:28,819
So that's what they do.

6
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:38,308
And of course, Chris is right to want to make sure that if we are making business related decisions off of the data, hey, shouldn't we make sure the data is accurate, right?

7
00:00:39,292 --> 00:00:45,939
That is a very low level thing to correct if we decide that we want to continue using bark, right?

8
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:51,446
The other piece of it is bark is never going to

9
00:00:53,522 --> 00:00:57,825
do is it's not an MMA tool, the way Prestian did, right?

10
00:00:57,925 --> 00:01:00,566
You're like, that's a whole different story.

11
00:01:00,787 --> 00:01:05,129
And I don't think profitability in CAC and all like, well, CAC is separate.

12
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:15,756
Profitability at the individual product level, that's not something we're going to use Prestian for, which makes me feel like just doesn't understand how to use bark, which is addressable, but good to know that that's where we stand.

13
00:01:15,936 --> 00:01:16,156
Right.

14
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:16,356
Yeah.

15
00:01:16,597 --> 00:01:21,000
That's what I was thinking as well as I don't I don't think pressing it would be the ideal replacement for that.

16
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,621
Talking to Chris directly.

17
00:01:23,062 --> 00:01:28,486
Yes, because he has his hands and everything and understands the economics of everything as well.

18
00:01:28,646 --> 00:01:32,609
So like he would definitely be that middle ground point of contact to figure that out.

19
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:35,752
So that's why I was like very receptive to him like intercepting him essentially.

20
00:01:36,485 --> 00:01:36,845
Totally.

21
00:01:36,905 --> 00:01:40,307
And so we don't touch Prestian in this conversation at all.

22
00:01:40,327 --> 00:01:44,570
Let's separate that so that we don't have to like keep in complications, right?

23
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,092
The other side of it is Chris.

24
00:01:47,852 --> 00:01:58,639
Chris is the person really who needs to determine what tool he likes using for individual product level and then total contribution margin profitability.

25
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:02,021
I know that he likes that tool polar.

26
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:06,096
I don't know, you've probably not even touched it because I don't even touch it.

27
00:02:06,116 --> 00:02:08,562
It's like a Chris tool entirely, right?

28
00:02:08,582 --> 00:02:09,184
Okay.

29
00:02:09,825 --> 00:02:11,590
The main thing is, right?

30
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:20,215
I don't, we need to understand what where polar starts and ends and where bark starts and ends.

31
00:02:20,396 --> 00:02:27,663
And if there is redundancy, if one of them can take over for the other, because if that's the case, right?

32
00:02:27,703 --> 00:02:34,369
So like, for example, there could be a world where, and I'll say this to Chris too, there could be a world where polar

33
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,892
is just Chris's business intelligence tool as a CFO, right?

34
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:48,077
And then we use bark and pression to make like marketing level decisions, cap acquisition, what we're investing in, we're not investing in product, right?

35
00:02:48,638 --> 00:03:00,965
And so that would be my suspicion is that, and then what ends up happening then is Chris has to decide does he want to pay for two tools, Polar and Bark, or does he want to make bark

36
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:09,219
accurate and useful to his polar tools like what he's using polar for and then we just have one system which is bark.

37
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,544
Okay, okay, yes, that makes sense.

38
00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:26,406
I think there's definitely probably going to be overlap between the tools, but one is more geared towards like, obviously probably pollers more geared towards CFOs, whereas barks more geared towards marketers.

39
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:31,731
So there's maybe overlapping data, but how the tools are leveraged and could be different.

40
00:03:31,771 --> 00:03:39,296
So I can definitely dive in, get an understanding of the two, have a conversation with Chris to get his perspective to which certain lines of yours.

41
00:03:40,157 --> 00:03:45,121
But that way I can just kind of meet him where he's at and understanding and then help him kind of

42
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:48,222
get that we're trying to leverage these tools slightly differently.

43
00:03:48,682 --> 00:04:02,248
If it comes to that, if there's no like, hey, they're basically the exact same thing, the UIs are similar, we're getting daily emails with the same metrics and they align, then like it makes sense to pick one over the other and not publish this leverage.

44
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:06,690
Super line there.

45
00:04:08,578 --> 00:04:14,166
Thanks for the clarity, because I was like, it's just kind of got.

46
00:04:14,186 --> 00:04:17,971
Yeah, spider webby, like it's just going a few different directions.

47
00:04:20,075 --> 00:04:21,517
And then for

48
00:04:24,156 --> 00:04:35,364
Oh bridge just how the conversation with bridge guy over bridge tool seems pretty Useful for our needs especially with us ramping up content creator and influencer partnerships.

49
00:04:35,764 --> 00:04:40,847
They can have custom bridge pages That can make those experiences a little bit more unique to their personal brand.

50
00:04:41,968 --> 00:04:44,630
I think you know computer leverage with our

51
00:04:45,370 --> 00:05:01,098
existing social placements to drive warranty sign-ups is that something like a 30% I guess like warranty sign-up rate and then like a 10% conversion rate overall of the of the traffic that like signs up

52
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:12,525
Yeah, of the traffic that signs up for the warranty, 10% of them ultimately end up driving more revenue, which kind of justifies the cost of the product.

53
00:05:13,265 --> 00:05:17,287
And he walked through the demonstration with me.

54
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:18,308
This is the second call.

55
00:05:18,668 --> 00:05:20,129
We'll walk through the pricing infrastructure.

56
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:21,450
So it all seems

57
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:22,790
Aligned.

58
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:47,482
I think only concern is like some of the activations they have that are more like physical real-world marketing for event activation things to do with retail things that QR codes and packaging from a digital side it seems like we can stand things that pretty quickly on the physical side it seems like there will be a lot of large business decisions to make on how to implement it from that standpoint and he also let me know that they'll do a

59
00:05:48,422 --> 00:05:56,532
Kind of like a two month opt out like if we're not seeing the value then we don't have to opt into the full 12 month month a month or annual contract that they typically have brand sign.

60
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:59,596
So it seems like there's a bit of leverage and there is a

61
00:06:01,869 --> 00:06:07,393
You know someone there personally, they know Sharma Brands, they're offered us a 10% discount on the monthly.

62
00:06:07,754 --> 00:06:13,118
So it seems like there's a lot of incentives here to get us to do business with them, but just kind of want to hear your thoughts on it.

63
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:23,708
I think it makes sense to implement from a digital standpoint, kind of replace it's a better link tree if that makes sense, but just wanted to hear if you had any insight to your thoughts.

64
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:30,422
Yeah, I guess maybe I, I don't know, do you know how much it overlaps with loud crowd?

65
00:06:30,482 --> 00:06:31,923
Do you know anything about loud crowd?

66
00:06:31,943 --> 00:06:33,425
I don't know anything about loud crowd.

67
00:06:34,426 --> 00:06:38,789
Can you have Anastasia walk you through loud crowd?

68
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:39,910
You should know it anyway.

69
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:43,293
But then just see what the differences are.

70
00:06:43,313 --> 00:06:44,474
Yeah, okay.

71
00:06:44,734 --> 00:06:47,056
Yeah, I think a lot like loud crowd.

72
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:50,900
Yeah, it seems like there's quite a few yeah creator storefronts.

73
00:06:53,143 --> 00:06:58,789
Yeah, yeah, and I could definitely see what the overlaps is here.

74
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:00,510
Yeah, they all have their own little differences.

75
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:10,000
Yeah, like the USP's a little bit different with bridge, but like they'll do offer this one crossover between the tools for what I can see so far.

76
00:07:11,902 --> 00:07:12,042
Yeah.

77
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:13,186
Okay, cool.

78
00:07:13,386 --> 00:07:24,218
That makes it easy because I was like, yeah, like I can see it fitting, but we may have some tool in this like ecosystem already that is kind of doing the same thing.

79
00:07:25,299 --> 00:07:25,840
It comes across.

80
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,080
Yep.

81
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:27,462
Yeah, exactly.

82
00:07:28,183 --> 00:07:28,523
Cool.

83
00:07:29,744 --> 00:07:31,326
I did send over the weekly report.

84
00:07:31,446 --> 00:07:33,828
I don't anticipate you had time to like view it.

85
00:07:35,109 --> 00:07:37,431
Right now, so I can, you wanted to walk me through it.

86
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:38,432
Yeah, for sure.

87
00:07:38,472 --> 00:07:47,940
So I got the executive summary up top, kind of showing the spin for this week versus previous week, not the week of week labeling, burnt down, paid me delivered.

88
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:54,766
Can you add the year over year, like week over week and year over year is important for me.

89
00:07:55,552 --> 00:08:00,055
Okay, in the executive summary, I do have your over your towards further down, but I can.

90
00:08:00,536 --> 00:08:01,436
Yeah, yeah.

91
00:08:01,576 --> 00:08:04,298
So there is a table for it, but just not referenced in the year.

92
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:07,721
Yeah, let's me go.

93
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:09,362
I'm just in the executive summary now.

94
00:08:11,383 --> 00:08:13,545
So what is dragging down.

95
00:08:13,565 --> 00:08:15,366
Is it metastill?

96
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:21,271
Um, yes, I would say men are still bringing down the efficiency overall.

97
00:08:21,551 --> 00:08:22,593
It's gotten better over the weekend.

98
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:26,298
Over that seven day period, it didn't look too strong, but over the weekend, that's where we saw the biggest uplift.

99
00:08:26,318 --> 00:08:27,679
And it's kind of maintaining through the week.

100
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,322
So we started to see better traction there.

101
00:08:30,163 --> 00:08:31,825
We did pull down spin, like Jake mentioned.

102
00:08:32,726 --> 00:08:47,274
about right at 3100 bucks and starting to see believe red light hat and the body care and supplements campaigns pick up tell him to go ahead and allocate the scale budget towards those campaigns since we're seeing a lot of traction there yeah

103
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:50,457
That's good.

104
00:08:50,477 --> 00:08:51,017
Okay.

105
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:54,818
And then how are the bundles doing?

106
00:08:55,838 --> 00:09:01,120
Bundles, it's still a little too early to tell since they are higher ARV products than a whole lot of spin there.

107
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,021
And what they're going to, I think they want us towards the end of last week.

108
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,922
But yeah, I haven't, not anything notable yet.

109
00:09:10,802 --> 00:09:12,903
Do we, are they working on creative?

110
00:09:13,563 --> 00:09:13,823
Yes.

111
00:09:14,623 --> 00:09:17,804
They had some deliverables from what I

112
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,663
Remember earlier this week on a call.

113
00:09:25,644 --> 00:09:30,146
They had some stuff that they wanted to run by Laura, which I think they reached out to her on.

114
00:09:31,207 --> 00:09:32,047
Okay.

115
00:09:32,067 --> 00:09:41,651
And I just, I'm, I need convincing to not completely shut off app 11.

116
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:44,824
Yeah, I would say TikTok over Abloven.

117
00:09:44,904 --> 00:09:53,416
Abloven definitely has a stronger efficiency over like there's more there, but after we started using our own money, Abloven's performance just kind of went down down.

118
00:09:54,838 --> 00:09:57,201
But Abloven and TikTok for sure, long shopping buck.

119
00:09:58,126 --> 00:09:59,086
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

120
00:09:59,246 --> 00:10:06,709
And I'm fine with like shutting it off for the summer and just like putting more into like CTV and that kind of stuff to like build the funnel up.

121
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,390
Yep.

122
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,470
No, I totally agree.

123
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:16,233
Um, I think that we can reallocate those dollars more effectively, like during the summer, we want to test other things anyway.

124
00:10:16,253 --> 00:10:18,494
And we can see that clearly these channels aren't producing much.

125
00:10:18,954 --> 00:10:24,357
So like since we're in the summer of testing, we might as well allocate that spend towards something that is going to produce.

126
00:10:25,277 --> 00:10:25,817
That's right.

127
00:10:26,157 --> 00:10:26,618
That's right.

128
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:27,578
Um,

129
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:29,655
Okay.

130
00:10:29,835 --> 00:10:37,057
And then the other piece is I, so we're going to do our Labor Day sale.

131
00:10:37,077 --> 00:10:39,077
Okay.

132
00:10:39,437 --> 00:10:41,578
I'm aligning on the dates right now.

133
00:10:41,758 --> 00:10:45,539
I love your perspective on like what happened last year.

134
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:55,441
Winds losses like a little summary so that we can then kick off with like last year's performance information and then learn how to make it better.

135
00:10:55,461 --> 00:10:56,181
Okay.

136
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:56,621
Cool.

137
00:10:58,987 --> 00:11:01,348
And then same thing with like top-performing creative.

138
00:11:01,368 --> 00:11:04,270
If we have that, that will be helpful.

139
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,230
Yeah, let's just prep for Labor Day.

140
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,031
Okay.

141
00:11:07,551 --> 00:11:07,831
Cool.

142
00:11:07,951 --> 00:11:09,092
We can definitely dig in.

143
00:11:10,092 --> 00:11:10,832
Motion.

144
00:11:11,353 --> 00:11:15,454
Who are we getting contact with Chris to get access to motion art?

145
00:11:15,534 --> 00:11:18,156
No, I actually have motion to give to you.

146
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:19,176
So give me one second.

147
00:11:19,876 --> 00:11:20,917
I may have it.

148
00:11:22,117 --> 00:11:26,539
You may and you may not, because that's world and Chris is usually faster at that stuff.

149
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:27,220
Okay, here we go.

150
00:11:30,734 --> 00:11:31,455
Let me see.

151
00:11:31,475 --> 00:11:33,997
I don't know yet.

152
00:11:34,037 --> 00:11:36,418
Yeah, yeah, I've heard Jordan.

153
00:11:36,438 --> 00:11:37,980
There it goes.

154
00:11:41,082 --> 00:11:43,684
Oh, it says invite membership already exists.

155
00:11:44,464 --> 00:11:45,806
No, that is all needed.

156
00:11:45,866 --> 00:11:47,647
So most of it came through when I did not accept.

157
00:11:48,327 --> 00:11:49,428
Let me see.

158
00:11:49,468 --> 00:11:50,789
We send it.

159
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:55,913
Yeah, because it expired.

160
00:11:55,973 --> 00:11:56,514
I did just fine.

161
00:11:56,554 --> 00:11:57,634
Yeah, yeah.

162
00:11:57,655 --> 00:11:59,136
Go ahead and announce it.

163
00:12:02,057 --> 00:12:02,499
My chest.

164
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:22,824
but also to note, since kind of on the topic of creative, Meta UGC creators are starting to pull really well.

165
00:12:23,344 --> 00:12:32,327
I mean, we are indexed more heavily on UGC content on Meta than other channels, but that was one thing that they mentioned.

166
00:12:32,347 --> 00:12:36,269
They kind of have a good backlog of stuff to test through with Anastasia.

167
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:40,791
So I think that's kind of gonna be the focus while I get some of this other stuff delivered.

168
00:12:41,571 --> 00:12:43,272
It's to get more of the,

169
00:12:44,386 --> 00:12:46,467
I guess, light listing, influencer content.

170
00:12:46,487 --> 00:12:47,808
Tested in in the article.

171
00:12:48,628 --> 00:12:48,908
Yeah.

172
00:12:49,109 --> 00:12:49,449
Okay.

173
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:50,529
That sounds great.

174
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:55,492
And that's with agency H should also be helping with that and anesthesia.

175
00:12:55,952 --> 00:12:56,192
Yes.

176
00:12:56,393 --> 00:12:56,613
Yes.

177
00:12:56,753 --> 00:12:57,153
Exactly.

178
00:12:58,554 --> 00:12:58,774
Yeah.

179
00:12:58,894 --> 00:13:05,938
They've reached out to anesthesia in one of the group chats regarding some updates on the tracker that they've been using.

180
00:13:07,318 --> 00:13:07,719
Perfect.

181
00:13:07,859 --> 00:13:08,679
Okay.

182
00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:09,400
I'm going.

183
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,421
I just deleted you in motion.

184
00:13:11,461 --> 00:13:12,441
I'm just going to react you.

185
00:13:12,461 --> 00:13:13,021
Okay.

186
00:13:13,722 --> 00:13:13,962
Thank you.

187
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:25,780
Tell me if you get that email.

188
00:13:46,967 --> 00:13:49,708
When I deleted your access, did you get an email that you got deleted?

189
00:13:49,768 --> 00:13:50,488
Oh no.

190
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,230
Okay, that's good.

191
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:57,254
Because I just deleted some things that might be controversial, but I don't care.

192
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:10,902
All right, so you got motion and then yeah, I'd love to just get like, uh, get our ducks in a row for Labor Day.

193
00:14:11,362 --> 00:14:16,646
Yeah, I think actually if we have a strong day today, we might actually catch up.

194
00:14:16,946 --> 00:14:17,226
Yes.

195
00:14:17,246 --> 00:14:17,426
Yeah.

196
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:26,156
Mm-hmm, today so far we're at one.

197
00:14:26,236 --> 00:14:27,096
It's a little soft.

198
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:30,899
It means about the same as yesterday, but that's fine.

199
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:32,000
We just need to.

200
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,560
We got it.

201
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,743
Looks like we may have sent an email yesterday because we got a bomb at like 5 p.m.

202
00:14:36,763 --> 00:14:41,847
Oh, sure.

203
00:14:43,468 --> 00:14:45,189
Yeah, sure.

204
00:14:45,289 --> 00:14:47,911
Up 36% I could be.

205
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:50,713
Yeah, but like that's up, I think, to the previous day.

206
00:14:52,895 --> 00:14:55,577
I'm just looking at the like, I guess, sessions.

207
00:14:55,697 --> 00:14:57,058
Yeah, orders are up 56.

208
00:14:57,278 --> 00:14:58,239
Yeah, today's good.

209
00:14:58,759 --> 00:14:59,840
Yeah, we should.

210
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,122
I mean, let me month to date doesn't include.

211
00:15:03,222 --> 00:15:04,563
It doesn't include the 23rd.

212
00:15:04,783 --> 00:15:06,044
So today's 23rd.

213
00:15:06,204 --> 00:15:06,444
Yeah.

214
00:15:06,945 --> 00:15:15,110
So reporting at 2% if we continue strong, then like we should definitely cut that down for another chunk in about seven more days to kind of pump it.

215
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,391
So it's right.

216
00:15:16,591 --> 00:15:20,494
And we need to have a strong weekend, which I think we will now that things are a little bit

217
00:15:21,283 --> 00:15:24,505
Yeah, get email and SMS up to date.

218
00:15:24,545 --> 00:15:28,268
Let me actually, I think I have their numbers here.

219
00:15:28,288 --> 00:15:31,390
I'm catching everything up here now.

220
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:31,951
Okay.

221
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:38,496
Yeah, today's definitely, and spend is overall month to date.

222
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,581
Here we are.

223
00:15:47,882 --> 00:15:48,463
That's fine.

224
00:15:50,213 --> 00:15:54,717
I think we were pacing higher on the last update for month and date versus year.

225
00:15:55,378 --> 00:15:57,339
Yeah, we got to just cut that Pinterest.

226
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,161
Like get it, get it in line.

227
00:15:59,361 --> 00:16:05,286
We got to be spend last make more and that's like waste and Pinterest and Apple oven is stupid.

228
00:16:05,727 --> 00:16:07,268
Yeah.

229
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:12,553
So we'll get continue to cut those at the fact.

230
00:16:15,765 --> 00:16:20,007
And then once we have more, I understand the argument of like, oh, it's helping top of funnel or whatever.

231
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:21,047
I don't fully believe that.

232
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:28,130
And to once we have pression, then we can actually make more informed decisions versus like a feeling that we have.

233
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,050
Yeah.

234
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,370
And I totally agree.

235
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,552
I feel like a top of funnel channel that's supposed to be top of funnel, like awareness play.

236
00:16:35,552 --> 00:16:39,854
We're looking for, we came on to have loving looking for direct conversions, not to pump awareness.

237
00:16:40,456 --> 00:16:40,736
Right.

238
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,477
And I've seen it perform well for other brands.

239
00:16:43,517 --> 00:16:46,898
There's just takes there's a lot of creative testing involved with it to get to that point.

240
00:16:47,858 --> 00:16:51,439
So we probably just have to ramp up what we're testing on that channel.

241
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:54,000
But I don't want to increase spend and doing that.

242
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,280
I think there's a way to do it.

243
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:00,542
Testing other products at lower spends until we get traction and then go for that.

244
00:17:00,982 --> 00:17:04,283
But on the pressing piece, like, what is it waiting on first and verify data?

245
00:17:04,303 --> 00:17:05,523
Do we have to like have a call with them?

246
00:17:06,823 --> 00:17:07,423
I think so.

247
00:17:07,483 --> 00:17:09,204
Yeah, I think we need to schedule a call.

248
00:17:09,484 --> 00:17:12,886
Like if you're in, once you get in the system, it's going to like force you to call.

249
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:17,228
Yeah, like I've been clicking and I like I got that prompt once.

250
00:17:17,749 --> 00:17:20,010
No, it says we will be reaching out to schedule call with you.

251
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:25,332
And I haven't seen any communication and like I think pretty sure we followed up with pressing it.

252
00:17:25,993 --> 00:17:32,056
Have Ari go and like fix that because we should have.

253
00:17:35,652 --> 00:17:39,876
I mean, I'll email a CEO if that doesn't go any more, but... Is it Paul?

254
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:40,737
Yeah, Paul.

255
00:17:56,891 --> 00:17:58,913
It's going through the rest of your updates here.

256
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,030
Oh yeah, let me see.

257
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:10,834
You should also save this link and put it in the chat.

258
00:18:11,034 --> 00:18:12,835
Is it easier in the chat or if I slack you a link?

259
00:18:12,855 --> 00:18:14,395
Yeah, you can put it in the chat.

260
00:18:14,415 --> 00:18:16,596
I'll start.

261
00:18:16,676 --> 00:18:23,038
This is the CRM weekly update that I have Sharma send me.

262
00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:25,059
Okay.

263
00:18:26,826 --> 00:18:32,168
Yeah, so they're at 77% to goal as of Tuesday, yesterday.

264
00:18:32,188 --> 00:18:35,589
And what are we at?

265
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,510
There's 31 days.

266
00:18:44,253 --> 00:18:44,913
Yeah, so all right.

267
00:18:44,953 --> 00:18:50,735
So we're at 71% to the month as of yesterday.

268
00:18:50,895 --> 00:18:51,795
So they're actually pacing.

269
00:18:58,311 --> 00:19:07,017
I think, yeah, just, I wanted to go in with one, give more clarity of visibility into the performance of the channel.

270
00:19:07,377 --> 00:19:13,362
I see what's coming into Northean, but I also know like that's going to be different than what like, obviously Shawna sees as the impact.

271
00:19:13,382 --> 00:19:15,743
But yeah, I just want to make sure that we, yeah.

272
00:19:17,116 --> 00:19:29,742
can interact around and whatever we can do in the next seven days to drive more push more you know campaigns come with something then you know definitely down to explore it and they're just moving forward in general having more visibility.

273
00:19:30,623 --> 00:19:37,746
Yeah agree and that's great and if you want I can actually even add you to our weekly's which would be good for you to get the full picture.

274
00:19:37,766 --> 00:19:42,609
Yeah I mean you can like put those as optional but

275
00:19:44,164 --> 00:19:52,606
I think as long as you're checking in with Elise and like looking at the, yeah, it is, let me get onto Tuesday as yeah, let me just add you.

276
00:19:55,907 --> 00:19:57,988
Thank you for stepping up on that stuff.

277
00:20:00,348 --> 00:20:01,889
Okay, cool, cool, cool.

278
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:06,190
And then Awin and Estasia, how are you sinking with her?

279
00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:11,110
Um, the base is like, I reach out to her and chat and just kinda hate it.

280
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:15,971
Can we scale this up and she's definitely doing a crazy view-strawbing managing it because of the efficiency.

281
00:20:16,492 --> 00:20:17,552
Does get better as we spend.

282
00:20:17,972 --> 00:20:25,474
Last seven of the channel did come down a bit as she's like started to ramp up and add more vendors that make the last one she had some questions on.

283
00:20:26,954 --> 00:20:27,795
Where's our?

284
00:20:29,255 --> 00:20:30,135
Between the three of us.

285
00:20:30,155 --> 00:20:34,176
There was one more she was trying to bring on, but she pinged all of us.

286
00:20:34,356 --> 00:20:35,797
I thought I gave her enough insight.

287
00:20:37,325 --> 00:20:38,645
on moving forward.

288
00:20:38,685 --> 00:20:39,366
There it is.

289
00:20:42,226 --> 00:20:43,247
TV scientific.

290
00:20:43,307 --> 00:20:44,127
There's another one.

291
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:44,907
Get healthy you.

292
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:48,028
It's a new affiliate test.

293
00:20:48,368 --> 00:20:50,568
She said it on July 15th on Tuesday.

294
00:20:50,588 --> 00:20:55,170
I did follow up with her on my thoughts, but I don't know where that's actually just been her.

295
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:56,550
Yeah, I'll just hang out.

296
00:21:02,771 --> 00:21:08,434
And then my last question for you is on the creative for CTV.

297
00:21:08,554 --> 00:21:09,934
Catch me up on where we're at there.

298
00:21:09,954 --> 00:21:10,014
Yep.

299
00:21:10,815 --> 00:21:13,256
So Shaman has been briefed.

300
00:21:13,316 --> 00:21:16,097
They did just reach out this morning asking for creative specs.

301
00:21:16,177 --> 00:21:17,438
I let Lord know to put that.

302
00:21:18,158 --> 00:21:29,043
in the doc, but we're in the brief she sent over, but I think she got left out, but I said over the doc I put together and breaking down what CTV said to us for requirements and kind of a creative approach.

303
00:21:29,063 --> 00:21:31,304
So I should have that with Sharma, it's with them.

304
00:21:31,704 --> 00:21:35,606
So they're working, should be working on those creatives moving forward.

305
00:21:35,646 --> 00:21:36,666
They've got the requirements.

306
00:21:38,247 --> 00:21:41,248
Send this back to her team and let you know if we have any further questions.

307
00:21:41,268 --> 00:21:42,149
So that was as 29 minutes ago.

308
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:42,249
Okay.

309
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:42,549
Great.

310
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:46,843
Thank you.

311
00:21:46,863 --> 00:21:50,145
I, yeah, I keep seeing more and more ads.

312
00:21:50,285 --> 00:21:57,549
Oh, the other big thing is I can't recall if this was in the brief, but I do think it's really important for us to include all of our awards.

313
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,370
We have so many laurels.

314
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:06,593
We have like Oprah's Choice, Vogue, L Beauty Awards on like a million of our products.

315
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:09,115
So we have rights to all of that.

316
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:10,495
So that should definitely be shown.

317
00:22:11,977 --> 00:22:17,781
Where can I get a comprehensive list of all, so I can just empower them like, hey, here's all publications, here's all their awards.

318
00:22:18,321 --> 00:22:21,683
I think they actually have the link to the laurels folder.

319
00:22:21,863 --> 00:22:26,226
If not, like, put it in and tell them and then tell them if they have the link to the folder.

320
00:22:26,246 --> 00:22:27,326
I think they do.

321
00:22:29,568 --> 00:22:36,552
To laurels folder that has all of the laurels that they're called award laurels, I'll put it in the chat.

322
00:22:36,949 --> 00:22:39,913
Okay, that's what I thought you were saying when I was like, oh, maybe she may.

323
00:22:40,073 --> 00:22:41,695
I know they're too similar and likely.

324
00:22:42,136 --> 00:22:42,416
Okay.

325
00:22:42,436 --> 00:22:43,037
Let's see.

326
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:12,183
Thank you.

327
00:23:12,283 --> 00:23:12,624
All right.

328
00:23:12,644 --> 00:23:20,590
What else do you need from me?

329
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,352
How can I be helpful to you?

330
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:42,842
That's it.

331
00:23:42,882 --> 00:23:46,385
There may have been questions.

332
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:55,374
There was one question and I need to look in our threads and you popped up yesterday.

333
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:58,570
Oh, Bing, who's managing Bing?

334
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:01,392
Because it's Crackling Club.

335
00:24:01,492 --> 00:24:02,773
I saw that in the chat.

336
00:24:03,634 --> 00:24:05,055
No one is a short answer.

337
00:24:05,075 --> 00:24:10,939
It was being managed by our old agency, Block and Tam, and no one is managing it right now.

338
00:24:11,379 --> 00:24:13,160
So do you have access to anything?

339
00:24:13,581 --> 00:24:13,981
I don't.

340
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:15,402
Chris gave Sharma access.

341
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:16,603
I need to get access.

342
00:24:16,703 --> 00:24:22,387
I should have asked for it yesterday, but they have access and we're all already went in and got some recommendations.

343
00:24:22,467 --> 00:24:25,369
I just didn't know if I could greenlight it or not because somebody else is managing it, but

344
00:24:25,829 --> 00:24:27,132
We'll go out and get back to there.

345
00:24:27,853 --> 00:24:28,635
That's all yours.

346
00:24:29,016 --> 00:24:29,256
Cool.

347
00:24:29,797 --> 00:24:30,058
Sweet.

348
00:24:30,518 --> 00:24:31,961
Yeah, I was, I believe last night.

349
00:24:32,442 --> 00:24:34,105
Last night I needed to clear the on.

350
00:24:35,648 --> 00:24:35,989
Perfect.

351
00:24:38,142 --> 00:24:41,384
Um, and then are we off Pinterest entirely?

352
00:24:41,404 --> 00:24:44,726
Um, we, it's down to 50 bucks a day.

353
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:47,007
We talked about pausing, but no confirmation there.

354
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:57,012
So I'll follow up with are you on that to see if we pause it down, then work on reducing TikTok and app love and spend until we can kind of phase those out.

355
00:24:57,693 --> 00:24:59,394
Um, I don't think that

356
00:25:00,824 --> 00:25:08,939
I told them, on TikTok to focus on one product, they're trying to manage two products in low budget spend and we've got high of knees across the board, except for body care and supplements, so it's like

357
00:25:09,616 --> 00:25:14,279
You're really splitting that budget teeth in to move the needle and the body sculptors showed the most signs there.

358
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:17,540
So I feel like we should keep you going at that until we get the channel to a better spot.

359
00:25:19,341 --> 00:25:23,584
And then app love and we were only had only tested the one products.

360
00:25:23,644 --> 00:25:29,727
I need to tap in to see what other campaigns they've watched since that conversation.

361
00:25:30,167 --> 00:25:30,628
And then

362
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,972
So believe that was Tuesday last week that we kind of went in.

363
00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:42,482
And yeah, so I'll follow up with them on what the strategy direction for those channels and bring bringing spend on.

364
00:25:43,683 --> 00:25:45,886
Yeah, okay, great, great, great, great.

365
00:25:45,946 --> 00:25:47,028
Same thing with Pinterest.

366
00:25:47,068 --> 00:25:50,152
I just feel like we didn't we don't have proper creative and Pinterest either.

367
00:25:51,187 --> 00:26:03,278
No, and yeah, Pinterest is another, like I don't know if we have, I guess there is now the time to be focusing in deploying resources into those channels is my question to you.

368
00:26:03,418 --> 00:26:03,879
Exactly.

369
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:05,160
I don't think so.

370
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,022
Okay, yeah, I'm aligned with you there.

371
00:26:07,122 --> 00:26:11,686
So we can revisit those since there is going to be a bit more investment required.

372
00:26:12,265 --> 00:26:15,726
and I feel like getting Meta in a better place and putting more attention.

373
00:26:15,746 --> 00:26:20,367
The resources there is a better use of our time and dollars.

374
00:26:20,727 --> 00:26:35,691
So, because if we turn Meta around like and get that, you know, three percent increments, it's a much larger swing on performance and top line impact than trying to dial in Pinterest and Apploven and take talk and a couple of grand a day collectively.

375
00:26:37,631 --> 00:26:38,451
And also, we get nowhere.

376
00:26:38,671 --> 00:26:39,992
So, yep, we're online there.

377
00:26:41,472 --> 00:26:41,712
Okay.

378
00:26:44,594 --> 00:26:45,034
Perfect.

379
00:26:45,774 --> 00:26:49,235
Yeah, I think CTV just deserves all of our attention right now.

380
00:26:49,716 --> 00:26:51,336
Yeah, I agree.

381
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:57,098
I'd rather see what the opportunities are there versus continuing to spend wheels and things that we haven't seen traction.

382
00:26:57,738 --> 00:27:01,699
And then also TikTok on the year spin is like 200 can.

383
00:27:01,719 --> 00:27:10,422
I don't feel like that is like we've kind of got enough conclusive evidence there for my opinion to make a decision on whether it's worth it.

384
00:27:11,462 --> 00:27:11,802
I agree.

385
00:27:12,523 --> 00:27:24,489
So, at least for now, but yeah, we'll line there and then we can just start putting more attention to CTD, take away from those, making sure we've got enough creative resources for the primary channels.

386
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:26,950
Yep, yep, exactly.

387
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,332
All right.

388
00:27:29,352 --> 00:27:29,732
Amazing.

389
00:27:29,772 --> 00:27:30,172
Okay, great.

390
00:27:30,372 --> 00:27:31,073
Anything else for me?

391
00:27:31,593 --> 00:27:32,033
No, ma'am.

392
00:27:32,053 --> 00:27:33,434
Appreciate time.

393
00:27:33,654 --> 00:27:34,054
Thank you.

394
00:27:34,114 --> 00:27:34,895
Appreciate your time.

395
00:27:34,915 --> 00:27:35,795
All right, thank you very much.

396
00:27:36,015 --> 00:27:36,215
Peace.

397
00:27:53,183 --> 00:27:54,164
Navigating everything, okay?

398
00:27:56,628 --> 00:27:57,989
For YouTube, you find it everything.

399
00:28:19,121 --> 00:28:20,021
I don't know, I don't know.

400
00:28:37,623 --> 00:28:40,885
The rights to the access to the interior of the great pyramid.

401
00:28:41,226 --> 00:28:45,549
And they also owned some of the right to Shaco Canyon and a certain area in Great Britain.

402
00:28:45,609 --> 00:28:47,891
They didn't have the right to go walk up here on.

403
00:28:48,371 --> 00:28:51,693
In 2000, they go 2018.

404
00:28:52,234 --> 00:28:56,357
And I got to stop all my guys with these cars.

405
00:28:56,557 --> 00:28:58,018
No, you lost your goods.

406
00:28:58,118 --> 00:28:58,418
No.

407
00:28:58,458 --> 00:28:59,079
No, man.

408
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:00,380
But they had all the tickets.

409
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,500
They had all the ARB teams.

410
00:29:02,837 --> 00:29:03,958
And black hats.

411
00:29:04,018 --> 00:29:05,039
And they stopped me going into the area.

412
00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:07,020
I was told by the guy that he couldn't go there.

413
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,241
I thought he lost me.

414
00:29:08,441 --> 00:29:09,121
They stopped me.

415
00:29:09,201 --> 00:29:11,243
And I said, let me ask you a question.

416
00:29:11,263 --> 00:29:12,143
I'm not on the back.

417
00:29:12,163 --> 00:29:13,544
Why can't I come over here?

418
00:29:32,997 --> 00:29:37,919
But again, the NASA narrative comes up again.

419
00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:49,122
So India, Egypt, the Grand Canyon, Chaco Canyon, as four places that I know now that NASA has had some level of control on antiquities and ancient knowledge.

420
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:54,152
and don't forget space, you know, all these videos that have been surprising.

421
00:29:54,172 --> 00:29:56,554
You know, this is astonishing.

422
00:29:56,574 --> 00:30:00,097
So let's get to the function of this.

423
00:30:00,597 --> 00:30:03,139
Let's just go back in time, 40,000 years ago.

424
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,583
Did this, in your opinion, happened in a short amount of time?

425
00:30:07,683 --> 00:30:12,727
Did it come from the skies and just kind of bend itself into the surface?

426
00:30:12,827 --> 00:30:16,990
Or what was the engineering bottom line of the function of this thing?

427
00:30:17,847 --> 00:30:27,951
But when you go into some of the ancient texts, you read a new text that, though, is with his father, Gautley, who gone his auntie in the Sumerian taverns.

428
00:30:29,132 --> 00:30:34,954
And his father tells him it's time to fulfill the plan that we know of, or that he know of.

429
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:39,036
He said, give your crew together and get into the great ship of the master.

430
00:30:40,036 --> 00:30:41,937
And, you know, go handle this.

431
00:30:41,957 --> 00:30:44,118
It's from what the business was.

432
00:30:44,158 --> 00:30:47,499
He said that the fountains have received

433
00:30:47,992 --> 00:30:51,413
and the temples were coming up out of the mud.

434
00:30:52,293 --> 00:30:59,975
So he tells the sun fell to get his crew together, get into the sky ship, and they sail upwards into the sky.

435
00:30:59,995 --> 00:31:01,415
They don't go across the ocean.

436
00:31:01,675 --> 00:31:05,076
They go up until the planet literally disappears.

437
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:05,816
This is in the text.

438
00:31:06,776 --> 00:31:10,937
Then when they get to the place appointed, they said, be neat, Gus.

439
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:21,187
We see the children of the land of camp that talk about ancient camping, pre-dagnastic Egypt, proposed called Egypt by the Greeks, was actually called camp.

440
00:31:22,086 --> 00:31:26,390
He says he can see the people beneath, down, so they decide to descend.

441
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:33,696
So again, this is the word that's demonstrating height and being above something altitude, they descend down to the land.

442
00:31:34,236 --> 00:31:43,163
When he opens up the doors and it should if it starts to come out, these people, they call them barbarians, come to attack them, probably because they're trying to protect their territory.

443
00:31:43,804 --> 00:31:47,707
He says he raised his staff and sends out a ray of vibration

444
00:31:48,147 --> 00:31:51,110
Starling and spill a sprang some stone of a mountain.

445
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:54,553
So he has this kind of a stun, non-leafed stun weapon.

446
00:31:55,354 --> 00:31:59,077
So I started looking into a kind of weapon like this actually even exists today.

447
00:31:59,097 --> 00:32:03,581
And I found the active denial system in the US military.

448
00:32:03,601 --> 00:32:04,602
I was in the imperial system.

449
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:05,403
It's in my book.

450
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:08,265
I wrote this in my book five years ago.

451
00:32:09,126 --> 00:32:13,991
The image of the analysis from the military, the length of the source, everything's in there.

452
00:32:14,964 --> 00:32:28,631
And they could send a beam of ray of energy at a group of people looking to attack or riot, and they can actually freeze them in their tracks, they can make them feel like they're in pain, they can make them vomit, they can be voices in their head, they can make me feel like they're on fire.

453
00:32:29,232 --> 00:32:37,036
It's a retelling non-alegal frequency that both says he has this 36,000 years ago in the ancient text.

454
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:48,442
But now he says, now I'm hearing his people, he says they begin to grovel at his feet because he's showing them his magic signs that translates today into advanced technology.

455
00:32:48,782 --> 00:32:49,903
So they believe he's a God.

456
00:32:50,123 --> 00:32:53,504
But as they grovel at his feet, he stops them and says, no.

457
00:32:54,544 --> 00:33:09,177
I'm not a guard, I'm a son of Atlantis, and I'm here to bring you back up to a high level of civilization, meaning at one point in the past prior to this great catastrophe, probably the underdrying, the underdrying system.

458
00:33:09,557 --> 00:33:15,525
They were already a high civilization, and he had been there before, but he says I'm here to bring back up to a higher level.

459
00:33:15,825 --> 00:33:25,597
And he says, long we stay to camp, get long and get long again, so we stay here for years, years, years, helping to rebuild this civilization after this great flood.

460
00:33:26,577 --> 00:33:33,479
And then he said to his team, and it was done, spread out around the world and duplicate what we did here.

461
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:39,720
And that's why you see similar temple styles, similar structures, similar pyramid styles all over the planet.

462
00:33:40,221 --> 00:33:53,384
They were the master architects, and they had humans that they had worked with and trained and taught the sacred knowledge of this construction technique, these masons, that them along with these other beings called

463
00:33:57,848 --> 00:34:03,631
On the ship too, work with the people to help construct these magnetic sites all over the world.

464
00:34:03,651 --> 00:34:08,092
I would always have a huge floor.

465
00:34:08,253 --> 00:34:14,095
If you don't have to ride all the covers, you just can't really blow your budget.

466
00:34:22,705 --> 00:34:26,787
There are cases of ease, and then there's zascies trying to check the thing that case of ease.

467
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:29,408
Back with their famous chicken fingers, jeeps, and I hope.

468
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,049

471
00:34:46,025 --> 00:34:49,847
Browns can you think it predicted you're in a training camp that's QB1.

472
00:34:50,267 --> 00:34:55,130
Cleveland's quarterback battle is beginning as a bout to begin with the start of the 2025 training camp.

473
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:58,431
Rookie's at bed, have a vision and reported to Barrel.

474
00:34:58,892 --> 00:35:04,915
As you keep things up, Mary K. Cabin predicts that Kenny Picket will have the upper hand for the end camp.

475
00:35:05,435 --> 00:35:14,460
Kenny Picket still has a slight edge in terms of being number one on the depth chart, adding in a training camp that would change Mary K. Cabin.

476
00:35:16,477 --> 00:35:18,378
If the gospel would have come to clean the ground.

477
00:35:19,999 --> 00:35:20,559
Keep the gospel.

478
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:20,999
Yes, yes.

479
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,540
Yes, he is.

480
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,341
Listen, she's a pop variety.

481
00:35:24,461 --> 00:35:25,382
And pop it.

482
00:35:25,882 --> 00:35:30,784
There's some reported that when they speak about, because they covered it for so long.

483
00:35:31,945 --> 00:35:32,165
Yes.

484
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,406
That's her change later.

485
00:35:34,686 --> 00:35:37,688
When she starts talking about the cowboy, take it to the bed.

486
00:35:37,708 --> 00:35:37,908
Yeah.

487
00:35:38,988 --> 00:35:39,208
Yeah.

488
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:41,770
Every time they take it, they're going to take it to the bed.

489
00:35:49,318 --> 00:35:51,259
It used to be that way with an animal shed.

490
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:52,560
We used to do this for her.

491
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,040
I don't know if she still does that.

492
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:54,961
Does the ants feel them?

493
00:35:55,241 --> 00:36:01,404
But when he talks, going in like yada, Mary Kate happens to go out until you go to sleep.

494
00:36:03,685 --> 00:36:10,468
I'm gonna say the quote about you guys.

495
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:11,909
I like what they don't.

496
00:36:12,029 --> 00:36:15,070
I like the fact that they put some things out most of the time.

497
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,111
It's all smoke and air.

498
00:36:18,081 --> 00:36:23,751
Coming back to the Los Angeles glippers, a senior insider broke the story into it as now shoms.

499
00:36:23,771 --> 00:36:27,878
One day, Chris Paul decided to return here to the Los Angeles glippers.

500
00:36:28,803 --> 00:36:36,488
When Chris Paul wanted to stay near his family in Los Angeles this upcoming season and the Clippers needed another reserved guard.

501
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:39,390
They needed someone at the point guard position to come up with it.

502
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,751
So it made it a perfect match up for it.

503
00:36:41,891 --> 00:36:48,936
We needed multiple sewers such as Milwaukee, Dallas, Charlotte, all the stress interest in Chris Paul in the last few weeks.

504
00:36:49,016 --> 00:36:52,758
But now the ability to join a contender, L.A., the history.

505
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:55,220
We should get through this together.

506
00:36:55,921 --> 00:36:56,902
I'm working at now.

507
00:36:57,042 --> 00:36:57,824
I'm fighting him.

508
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:11,684
I'm a deep team.

509
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,965
I'm totally pissed off.

510
00:37:12,985 --> 00:37:14,225
Very much to understand.

511
00:37:14,605 --> 00:37:16,526
It will come fluctuate night to night.

512
00:37:16,846 --> 00:37:17,446
Might play.

513
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:18,746
He might not play on some night.

514
00:37:18,806 --> 00:37:19,927
But they go to the start.

515
00:37:20,167 --> 00:37:22,307
Come off the bench and be a club and play a player.

516
00:37:22,627 --> 00:37:25,728
This is something that could have a pretty proper role coming off that clippers band.

517
00:37:25,788 --> 00:37:30,710
Yeah, I know his role may look a little bit different, but I'm a sucker for them to stay with you by the car.

518
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:31,490
You know what I mean?

519
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:38,512
I'm already the clips that have been circulating around the Internet of those locks that he clippers in the thought that we're going to get to see a new version of that once again.

520
00:37:38,812 --> 00:37:42,355
But this time it's going to be Chris's 21st season in the NBA.

521
00:37:42,736 --> 00:37:47,580
Do you have any reported to suggest that we should be thinking about this, that it's his last ride?

522
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:52,604
Like I'm told, Chris Paul is expected to retire after this season.

523
00:37:53,025 --> 00:37:55,727
He's going to go through training camp, go through the season.

524
00:37:56,067 --> 00:37:57,328
Like he always does.

525
00:37:57,388 --> 00:37:58,309
See how he goes.

526
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:02,213
But his plan is for this to be his final season.

527
00:38:02,273 --> 00:38:05,636
He told the Pat McLean show a month ago that he wanted to be back.

528
00:38:06,256 --> 00:38:08,797
And near his family, now he's back in Las Vegas.

529
00:38:08,817 --> 00:38:10,418
He got to do just that.

530
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:15,801
With a federal story, we'll finish to a 21 year illustrious Hall of Fame career.

531
00:38:16,021 --> 00:38:18,602
And it's so good to see him back in Clippers, Unicorn.

532
00:38:18,622 --> 00:38:20,923
That's going to be a treat for all of us fans, Shoms.

533
00:38:20,983 --> 00:38:22,384
Thank you so much for being talking to you.

534
00:38:22,664 --> 00:38:24,025
I get a little bit later in the show.

535
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:32,309
It's hard to fathom that this could be the last run in Shoms' day because he went for nearly 9.7 times this per game as the Spurs veteran leader.

536
00:38:32,749 --> 00:38:33,830
And this is what gets me.

537
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:39,332
He started in all 82 games last days, and it was just the second time he's done that in his career.

538
00:38:39,372 --> 00:38:44,974
He also did that in 2014-15 when he ranked 6th in MVP voting in 2016-24.

539
00:38:45,174 --> 00:38:46,715
The Los Angeles Clippers, of course.

540
00:38:46,735 --> 00:38:52,177
Since we say hello to our friends, Brian and Norris Kendrick, Perkins, Bobbie, and Mark, it's always good to have you in the studio, my friend.

541
00:38:52,517 --> 00:38:55,138
Brian, I am going to start with you here and talk about the fit.

542
00:38:55,438 --> 00:38:59,840
We're looking at an incredibly deep, if not a little bit of an older Los Angeles Clippers team.

543
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,201
How do you see C.P.

544
00:39:01,221 --> 00:39:01,901
through slotting here?

545
00:39:03,979 --> 00:39:06,661
Well, this is a great value sign for the clippers.

546
00:39:06,681 --> 00:39:16,650
They get a first ballot hall of favor really for a bargain basement contract because he was prioritizing staying home in Los Angeles ahead of playing time and roll.

547
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:21,374
He could have gone to Milwaukee as Sean's mentioned and gotten more guaranteed playing time.

548
00:39:21,394 --> 00:39:23,016
That's not going to be the case here.

549
00:39:23,096 --> 00:39:25,778
He from what I understand he's not going to have guaranteed playing time.

550
00:39:25,798 --> 00:39:26,799
There wouldn't be nights

551
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:35,235
where James Harden and their backup, Chris Dunn, get the minutes at point guard, and Chris Paul might not play at all, which is something you've never seen before.

552
00:39:35,715 --> 00:39:36,835
He has understood that.

553
00:39:36,855 --> 00:39:43,818
He understands that he is going to be in that spot that he has, and he wants to be a competitive team in the marketing, he wants to play a nearest family.

554
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:47,139
And look, there haven't been an understanding of James Harden.

555
00:39:47,179 --> 00:39:49,760
He and James Harden didn't have the greatest stuff.

556
00:39:50,185 --> 00:39:54,589
relationship when they were in Houston, Australia, but hard is on board with this signing.

557
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,291
They went to him with it first.

558
00:39:56,992 --> 00:40:00,255
He understands that he played the fifth most minutes in the league last year and anything

559
00:40:00,697 --> 00:40:04,440
The flickers can do to support and protect him as well, and that's what this move is.

560
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,702
Okay, you said a whole lot of important stuff, right?

561
00:40:06,742 --> 00:40:07,362
They're right.

562
00:40:07,622 --> 00:40:16,349
In fact, I had the most interest in work, and I thought that a guy who started an A to B's last season is okay with his role now to be coming off of the bench.

563
00:40:16,389 --> 00:40:17,990
You think you're a basketball perspective?

564
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:22,894
Because for his family, I am so very happy for Jane and the whole crew that Chris Paul is closer to home here.

565
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:24,435
We're a basketball perspective.

566
00:40:24,495 --> 00:40:26,477
Is this the right fit for this final season?

567
00:40:31,104 --> 00:40:37,945
Some stuff just cause more except the airfare and two flights this summer I had to download now.

568
00:40:37,985 --> 00:40:42,206
Wait, no house show you when bed's not.

569
00:40:56,045 --> 00:40:56,226
New?

570
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:57,968
The psychology-based weight loss company?

571
00:40:58,048 --> 00:41:00,632
Yes, new and combined medication and behavior change.

572
00:41:00,893 --> 00:41:02,495
So you can lose the weight and keep it up.

573
00:41:02,515 --> 00:41:03,356
And it starts at just $149.

574
00:41:03,436 --> 00:41:05,299
Yeah, it's a smart way to lose weight.

575
00:41:14,128 --> 00:41:16,631
Why did no one tell Florida drivers about this new rule?

576
00:41:16,951 --> 00:41:24,920
If you are currently in church, driving less than 50 miles a day to live in a qualified zip code, you can get an extremely high discount.

577
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:30,807
Additionally, if you have no tickets, I mean, if you have not received the ticket in three years,

578
00:41:31,307 --> 00:41:32,648
Do you get even more discounts?

579
00:41:33,228 --> 00:41:35,790
But do you think your auto insurance company will tell you that?

580
00:41:36,951 --> 00:41:37,551
I don't think so.

581
00:41:37,911 --> 00:41:38,732
Now listen to this.

582
00:41:39,152 --> 00:41:43,374
When Miranda, a good friend of mine, entered her zip code in comparisons.org.

583
00:41:43,455 --> 00:41:44,235
She was shocked.

584
00:41:44,815 --> 00:41:48,337
She found out her local insurance agent was ripping her off.

585
00:41:48,698 --> 00:41:49,518
Yes, literally.

586
00:41:50,019 --> 00:41:50,919
Ripping her off.

587
00:41:51,019 --> 00:41:55,662
She actually managed to reduce her insurance premium by 50%.

588
00:41:55,842 --> 00:41:58,664
Now this is the rule that everyone needs to know.

589
00:41:59,424 --> 00:42:00,605
Never, ever.

590
00:42:00,956 --> 00:42:06,298
buy insurance without comparing rates and discounts from an unbiased source first.

591
00:42:06,598 --> 00:42:11,480
Survey data indicates it's possible to save more than $500 per year on current rates.

592
00:42:14,673 --> 00:42:15,253
You know how?

593
00:42:15,513 --> 00:42:20,215
So comparisons.org put together this three simple six second quiz.

594
00:42:20,595 --> 00:42:28,558
And at the end, you'll get a list of the top offers that are catered to your specific driving preferences, zip code, and more.

595
00:42:29,038 --> 00:42:31,579
You can save up to 50% of your current trends.

596
00:42:31,819 --> 00:42:32,779
So what are you waiting for?

597
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:36,721

00:42:40,002 --> 00:42:43,563

00:42:46,014 --> 00:43:01,393

601
00:43:18,822 --> 00:43:21,384
to stay bomber in the last ends of this clip.

602
00:43:21,424 --> 00:43:25,187
They have officially become the nursing home for the NBA.

603
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:41,166
Now I'm serious, because if we think that this is about to move the needle for the glimpses for us being a belliger, not just a title contender, but competing at the Southwest in conference, it's not that I get it.

604
00:43:41,206 --> 00:43:47,289
Chris Paul, he brings great value whether he's playing or whether he's on the bench being at an extent to no time loop.

605
00:43:47,589 --> 00:43:54,632
But when I look at their roster, I look at a guy like Duhin, yes, he's a guy that can defend at a high level, but the flippers look old.

606
00:43:54,992 --> 00:44:04,456
And they still, to me, have a problem in their wing position when it comes down to death from guys that could compete and play at a high level on the defensive side of the days.

607
00:44:04,836 --> 00:44:07,617
Offensively, they got enough to put up points.

608
00:44:07,637 --> 00:44:16,040
They're going to have a good regular season, but it comes down to them competing in the Western Conference especially when they get postseason time.

609
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,343
Can I compete with the rights of the Houston O.K.C.W.A.L.A.?

610
00:44:20,503 --> 00:44:21,804
I just don't see.

611
00:44:21,944 --> 00:44:25,267
Look, I mean, this team, it goes as Kauai Liner goes, right?

612
00:44:25,367 --> 00:44:27,549
Ultimately, how healthy is Kauai Liner?

613
00:44:27,589 --> 00:44:30,491
And that is going to dictate what the Los Angeles Flipers are able to do.

614
00:44:30,551 --> 00:44:35,835
So if we're talking about 2017 and looking at all of these guys on this roster, this would be a four-middle for a middle group.

615
00:44:36,155 --> 00:44:39,296
But this is a little bit of an older group that we're looking at now.

616
00:44:39,536 --> 00:44:43,398
Bobby, can you just show us what this rotation could look like for the Los Angeles covers?

617
00:44:43,418 --> 00:44:45,338
Well, it's certainly deep here.

618
00:44:45,418 --> 00:44:45,958
It's bigger.

619
00:47:33,823 --> 00:47:44,189
Sure, that noise was done.

620
00:48:30,006 --> 00:48:32,068
I did a couple times with my asses.

621
00:48:42,379 --> 00:48:50,163
The ball I had is pulled this all of that and it's hard so it slipped some so I was like it hurt when it slipped up.

622
00:48:50,323 --> 00:48:50,923
Yeah.

623
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:51,963
Yeah.

624
00:48:52,063 --> 00:48:56,906
I just decided I was going to risk hurting myself more than helping myself trying to use that ball.

625
00:48:56,926 --> 00:48:59,927
And so it was going to be changing since I didn't grab five.

626
00:49:00,007 --> 00:49:04,709
It's like a little soccer ball, so it's really good.

627
00:49:05,289 --> 00:49:05,730
Yeah.

628
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:09,011
It worked okay, but I was happy.

629
00:49:14,757 --> 00:49:20,581
I feel like I did behind my back a little bit, but it's not here for me.

630
00:49:39,871 --> 00:49:40,331
I'm glad.

631
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:42,993
Because you didn't want to do it at all.

632
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:45,214
Because yeah, I'm the first buddy that did the last one.

633
00:49:45,234 --> 00:49:46,075
We'll go to the replay soon.

634
00:49:46,115 --> 00:49:46,635
I'm glad.

635
00:49:47,836 --> 00:49:48,156
I'm glad.

636
00:49:48,296 --> 00:49:51,018
You and your buddy didn't do it for a week now.

637
00:49:51,058 --> 00:49:51,918
He'll like it a little bit.

638
00:49:52,199 --> 00:49:55,300
It's a great appointment.

639
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,061
It's a great appointment.

640
00:49:57,262 --> 00:49:59,923
So, I was like, we visit today.

641
00:50:00,203 --> 00:50:07,868
Is it a loudhouse on the way?

I don't know if you want to go over there.

643
00:50:44,605 --> 00:50:45,646
How are you doing, lady?

644
00:50:45,766 --> 00:50:46,867
I'm good, how are you?

645
00:50:46,907 --> 00:50:55,354
This is my mom, my brother, I'm with you.

646
00:50:55,375 --> 00:50:55,655
Oh, hi, mom.

647
00:50:55,675 --> 00:50:55,775
Hi.

648
00:50:55,915 --> 00:50:56,355
How's it going?

649
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:14,980
We're down and just palms with this for another week, but otherwise all the kids have gone home and it has to start to fill in again.
