WEBVTT

00:02.030 --> 00:10.717
Okay, so the first step that I've been on here, I was under apps, and then I just, how about this, let's check out all the apps.

00:14.299 --> 00:15.440
And then you can create an app.

00:15.860 --> 00:18.502
There's a new version, a new flow for creating an app.

00:19.102 --> 00:19.543
Whoops.

00:21.724 --> 00:24.026
I didn't go through the whole process today.

00:24.106 --> 00:24.786
Nope, I sure didn't.

00:24.806 --> 00:28.649
So I'm going to, let's do a hard refresh just to make sure.

00:30.191 --> 00:35.787
Yeah, my app did not get created, so I'm going to create the new one for, not daily report, but comment status.

00:43.623 --> 00:45.325
Use cases, I don't think is important.

00:45.345 --> 00:49.267
Like you technically can do other and then kind of like apply for everything on the back end.

00:50.468 --> 00:51.849
Create an app without a use case.

00:52.369 --> 00:55.591
But I'm sure that we want posts.

00:56.032 --> 01:01.375
So I'm going to manage, I'm going to select the use case that says manage everything on page, on your page.

01:01.836 --> 01:06.719
And I also want to create and manage app ads.

01:07.239 --> 01:09.121
Those two things are pretty important to me.

01:12.876 --> 01:16.298
And we'll need to pull in information from both places.

01:17.078 --> 01:19.380
I'm going to put this in the business portfolio that I have here.

01:19.400 --> 01:27.244
No requirements are identified yet.

01:27.604 --> 01:29.305
This may change if you add more to this app.

01:32.907 --> 01:35.629
And now we can go to the dashboard.

02:00.877 --> 02:02.217
Welcome to the app dashboard.

02:02.637 --> 02:05.918
This is where you will manage all aspects of your app and data access.

02:05.938 --> 02:07.299
So it's a nice little pop-up here.

02:08.079 --> 02:08.679
And this, this

02:15.410 --> 02:15.730
See?

02:16.391 --> 02:24.978
And this just looks much different than the other process, like the way, let's say, for example, Daily Report is set up.

02:25.018 --> 02:29.902
And I believe it's because Daily Report is set up still at V17.

02:29.922 --> 02:36.547
So just all of this is different compared to, I don't want to create a new app.

02:36.787 --> 02:39.870
I want to go to my apps and look for comment status.

02:40.690 --> 02:40.891
Boom.

02:42.768 --> 02:45.330
Yeah, so just this layout here on the left-hand side is just a lot different.

02:47.832 --> 02:49.072
We're going to add use cases.

02:49.813 --> 02:52.115
Customize and manage everything on your page.

02:52.235 --> 02:53.295
Okay, let's see here.

03:04.559 --> 03:07.560
Okay, okay, this is exactly what I was looking for.

03:07.580 --> 03:08.580
This is exactly what I was looking for.

03:08.640 --> 03:08.900
Okay.

03:10.701 --> 03:23.204
Everything here should be for managing the pages manage engagement.

03:26.562 --> 03:27.924
Create, edit, and delete comments.

03:28.024 --> 03:30.047
Okay, this is where it gets a little sketch.

03:30.067 --> 03:40.781
Like if I hit this add button, it'll kind of like do some kind of background check on, I'm sure, my personal profile as well as the pages that I have access to to see if they want to grant that access to me.

03:41.122 --> 03:42.203
Pages management data.

03:48.297 --> 03:49.758
Manage post-read engagement.

03:49.978 --> 03:50.739
Okay, okay, here it is.

03:50.759 --> 03:52.200
This is what I was looking for.

03:52.760 --> 03:55.162
And it does require some kind of approval, so I didn't know that.

03:55.382 --> 03:57.163
Hopefully it's auto-approved, I'm not sure.

03:57.863 --> 04:04.188
But so far we've created an app, gone through the whole workflow, setup flow.

04:05.188 --> 04:06.649
Here it says customized use case.

04:06.689 --> 04:09.731
I just clicked on a button that was on that homepage once I got to the app.

04:10.772 --> 04:15.895
And here it says customized use case, customized use case settings and permissions to make your app work the way you want it to.

04:18.169 --> 04:24.553
And then here, I think specifically what I need, I don't necessarily need to manage the engagement for this particular very small use case.

04:25.053 --> 04:41.023
I just need to be able to read engagement, which allows your app to read contents, which means posts, videos, photos, videos, events posted by the page, read followers data, including name, PSID, and profile picture, and read metadata and other insights about their page.

04:41.903 --> 04:42.463
And then here,

04:46.460 --> 04:48.081
Okay, so actually that's not the one I need.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.563
I need pages read user content.

04:51.003 --> 05:02.250
And it says pages read user content permission allows your app to read user generated content on the page such as posts, comments, and ratings by users or other pages and to delete user comments on page posts.

05:03.811 --> 05:11.656
So I'm going to go ahead and here, public profile, read insights.

05:13.437 --> 05:15.078
Pages read user content is what I need.

05:17.483 --> 05:18.643
We're just gonna go ahead and add that one.

05:18.884 --> 05:20.144
It swirls, let's see.

05:20.164 --> 05:23.065
A little nervous about this one.

05:23.105 --> 05:24.786
Okay, it seems like it approved me.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.727
So I now can read user content, meaning comments on the page.

05:29.928 --> 05:40.492
And I'm gonna go back out to the homepage, to the dashboard, because the next use case that I need to customize is for ads, and I'll see if it has anything to do with comments here.

05:40.972 --> 05:45.934
So that was just the manage use cases, and now we're gonna go to the ads use cases.

05:49.068 --> 05:50.508
See if they got anything good for me.

05:52.129 --> 05:53.009
I don't need a tour.

05:53.409 --> 05:54.370
We can skip that part.

05:58.971 --> 05:59.091
Oh.

06:01.071 --> 06:12.055
Oh, okay, so this is something that you may need to set up on your end, actually, like have your own custom app because connect your business portfolio and ad accounts.

06:12.455 --> 06:16.656
Before you get started, you'll need to connect a business port and at least one ad account.

06:21.883 --> 06:25.526
I'll be honest, I don't know ad account IDs off the top of my head.

06:25.546 --> 06:28.108
So what are we talking about?

06:28.408 --> 06:32.271
Ads.facebook.com, is that what we're on?

06:34.533 --> 06:36.735
Which redirects me to facebook.com slash business.

06:42.739 --> 06:46.262
Instead of the start now button, let's go for, is there a learn?

06:46.342 --> 06:47.923
Okay, so there's definitely learn more.

06:47.943 --> 06:49.384
I want to be able to...

06:52.933 --> 07:02.599
There we go, there we go.

07:03.140 --> 07:03.980
Go to Ads Manager.

07:04.000 --> 07:10.264
That's what I want, adsmanager.facebook.com.

07:10.825 --> 07:12.886
Okay, they've changed just so much of this again.

07:21.511 --> 07:27.933
Once we're in the here, all tools, add account settings.

07:36.415 --> 07:37.075
Okay, here we go.

07:37.275 --> 07:39.056
I can grab the add account ID from here.

07:39.076 --> 07:42.457
Oops.

07:49.699 --> 07:50.880
Well, this is the, okay, okay.

07:51.060 --> 07:55.442
Let's grab one of these sound waves.

07:58.024 --> 08:06.448
So I'm switching from my native ad account that's attached to my, oh, potential reach estimates.

08:06.668 --> 08:07.469
Hilarious.

08:09.210 --> 08:10.890
Facebookpotentialreachlawsuit.com.

08:10.910 --> 08:11.491
I'll go to that later.

08:11.551 --> 08:12.731
Anyways, the point is that...

08:15.839 --> 08:21.663
We are now in the Soundwaves ad account, and I simply want the ad account ID, so whatever that is.

08:23.464 --> 08:30.488
Copy it, paste it, and then save it.

08:32.049 --> 08:33.330
Add platforms and app stores.

08:42.307 --> 08:43.728
I'm just going to put in website for now.

08:43.788 --> 08:44.808
Keep it nice and simple.

08:44.848 --> 08:46.809
Probably most likely to get approved as well.

08:46.829 --> 08:53.933
And then here's app ID when setting up the events.

08:55.153 --> 08:56.814
Okay, so I'm going to leave that blank.

08:56.834 --> 08:59.815
I'm not going to worry about the website URL for now.

08:59.835 --> 09:02.717
Just going to go to app events.

09:09.076 --> 09:12.118
Or settings under app events, sorry, and then go to quick start.

09:13.139 --> 09:14.180
Here's the quick start.

09:15.060 --> 09:18.143
Here's how we can set up the Facebook SDK for JavaScript.

09:26.529 --> 09:29.371
Oh, and this is where you'll verify the things.

09:29.711 --> 09:34.855
So it doesn't look like your app having access to the ads is actually all that.

09:38.383 --> 09:40.185
Useful in terms of reading comments.

09:42.868 --> 09:49.134
What I'm hoping is just because you have access to the page itself means you'll have everything you'll need.

09:49.274 --> 09:50.875
Facebook login for business settings.

09:51.936 --> 09:53.038
Some more OAuth stuff.

09:53.858 --> 09:57.001
All of this makes sense to me, but at least from what I can tell,

09:59.565 --> 10:09.474
Once you've created an app and you go into use cases or it's asking you to customize the use cases right off the bat, as long as you customize what you need to for manage everything on your page, I think you're good to go.

10:09.494 --> 10:15.259
And of course, your user ID, your personal Facebook user profile is connected to a bunch of these pages.

10:15.319 --> 10:18.762
And that's how we generate the tokens that we need to make things happen.

10:22.049 --> 10:31.932
From here on out, from using manage everything on your page down, I have very detailed step-by-step notes on what to do, so I'm not really worried beyond that point.

10:34.412 --> 10:42.754
I think this is fairly easy to do based on my notes here.

10:46.881 --> 10:53.906
And you want pages, manage metadata, read engagement, manage posts.

10:54.066 --> 10:56.328
Like all of these things, pages show list was already approved.

10:56.788 --> 10:59.290
So these are probably the four things that I need access to.

10:59.350 --> 11:01.992
I'm going to do a lot with the pages.

11:02.092 --> 11:03.713
And in this case, we're not.

11:03.813 --> 11:05.815
We're simply like, we want access to the comments.

11:05.875 --> 11:08.296
It's kind of like the number one thing.

11:08.777 --> 11:11.959
If we get access to more than that, like can do more than that through the app, cool.

11:11.979 --> 11:15.882
But for now, that's probably what we need the most.

11:19.685 --> 11:22.187
And here there's like a graph API Explorer.

11:22.567 --> 11:26.230
I've literally gone through all the steps that are necessary for creating.

11:26.250 --> 11:27.571
I forgot what the name of it is.

11:27.591 --> 11:29.112
It's just like generate tokens.

11:29.532 --> 11:33.495
So I have like an entire workflow using the standard library.

11:33.515 --> 11:35.277
I don't think I'm actually using anything custom.

11:35.297 --> 11:38.699
You don't have to import any other libraries.

11:39.079 --> 11:41.561
We just use what we need to from

11:45.914 --> 11:47.136
I accept, try accept.

11:47.917 --> 12:01.354
Yeah, we can generate long-lived user tokens and then page access tokens from what we're already working with here.

12:02.575 --> 12:05.399
And then we can understand how long they'll take to expire.

12:05.899 --> 12:09.323
Basically, this is the entire workflow for generating the tokens that we need.

12:10.224 --> 12:17.613
And with that token, with this set of tokens, the long live user token and the process page token, the process page token will get you access to all the comments.

12:17.653 --> 12:18.554
I'm pretty sure that's how that works.

12:20.908 --> 12:32.280
I need to dive a bit deeper into that part of the API and figure out how to feed it video IDs and all that good stuff, but I'm pretty sure this is about as far as we need to go to make sure we get what we need to out of this app.

12:32.921 --> 12:34.443
So that being said, I'm going to wrap it up here.
