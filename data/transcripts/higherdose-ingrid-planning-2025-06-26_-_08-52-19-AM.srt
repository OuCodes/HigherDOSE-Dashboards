1
00:00:00,029 --> 00:00:01,069
getting to those goals.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,250
Is that my sense?

3
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:08,152
And the platform breakdown.

4
00:00:10,113 --> 00:00:12,073
That's in historicals.

5
00:00:12,233 --> 00:00:12,494
OK.

6
00:00:12,874 --> 00:00:22,477
And then would we keep those percentages based off of the historicals or what we're seeing train like because obviously, Google and Meta have been like 50% the last 30 days.

7
00:00:23,198 --> 00:00:29,200
Do not do not use the historicals as anything but a spend reference.

8
00:00:30,827 --> 00:00:39,192
for like the growth changes and you can that like because that's the whole thing is like I don't want our strategy to be grounded in historical strategy.

9
00:00:39,212 --> 00:00:41,493
I don't think we're going to get to where we want to be that way.

10
00:00:43,754 --> 00:00:50,578
So once we know where we're going and what we need to happen, then we can sort of fine tune how we get there.

11
00:00:53,584 --> 00:00:58,405
And then you'll have like, you know, the actually, let me move these into here.

12
00:00:59,406 --> 00:01:04,587
June goes into Q2.

13
00:01:06,268 --> 00:01:08,268
And then July gets Q3.

14
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:12,309
Does this make sense of what I'm doing?

15
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,390
Yeah.

16
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,771
And then you'll basically have one of these

17
00:01:20,202 --> 00:01:23,303
You don't need to go into individual month by month unless you want to.

18
00:01:23,323 --> 00:01:24,403
It might be helpful.

19
00:01:24,463 --> 00:01:25,563
I don't know your processes.

20
00:01:26,683 --> 00:01:36,805
And then just so you know, when I build these, I just carry over the direct and organic from the previous year, just as reference, because we don't know what that's going to do.

21
00:01:39,905 --> 00:01:42,246
We can build the month by month together if you want to.

22
00:01:43,346 --> 00:01:48,327
So yeah, now that you know like what I'm trying to do, what part of it do you feel like you can take on?

23
00:01:49,417 --> 00:01:54,763
Yeah, the definitely the Q1 or Q4 summaries, like that all makes sense.

24
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,725
I mean, obviously, I'll just be adding the last few.

25
00:01:59,326 --> 00:02:19,153
I would say like just the channel breakdown would be the only thing I'm like a little iffy on just cuz I really stab at it don't know like I'm definitely confident and taking a stab at it but I wouldn't want to review it and just see like what you think would be best as well cuz even just getting a glimpse into it the other day when you're coming up with not a spin for the month of July.

26
00:02:20,613 --> 00:02:24,536
and just figure out the channel, like what do we want channel performance to be?

27
00:02:24,556 --> 00:02:28,398
So that was insightful, but just want to make sure we're aligned there.

28
00:02:28,538 --> 00:02:31,780
But yeah, I think the summary is, I'll be able to do it.

29
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:39,365
Yeah, and honestly, I think the part that you're saying you need help with is the part that's the most, is gonna have the most fluctuation.

30
00:02:39,505 --> 00:02:42,987
And I also don't think it makes sense for us to do it in a vacuum without Sharma.

31
00:02:44,088 --> 00:02:47,610
So what I would do, and actually this is, I think I did this for June, okay.

32
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:51,672
in these individual summaries, and then we can probably do it.

33
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:55,054
Yeah, so like in here, so let's just do this now for July.

34
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:59,156
It's actually paid search is what I'm going to call this.

35
00:02:59,276 --> 00:03:02,338
And then this will be, oh, whoops, this is paid social.

36
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:05,059
And then there's paid search.

37
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:16,125
And then actually there should be lead gen or like, what are we calling this?

38
00:03:16,645 --> 00:03:17,946
Gen, like,

39
00:03:22,455 --> 00:03:24,296
Demand Gen is my brain.

40
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:30,000
So that's like, Demand Gen is all the top of funnel.

41
00:03:33,242 --> 00:03:33,482
Right?

42
00:03:33,502 --> 00:03:38,045
So for YouTube, right?

43
00:03:38,165 --> 00:03:39,526
Like that's paid.

44
00:03:39,746 --> 00:03:41,347
That's what they call it on YouTube.

45
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:50,554
But like, we can also use Demand Gen on CTV.

46
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:51,114
That's it.

47
00:03:54,082 --> 00:04:08,044
And I would say for me, this whole bucket is like your awareness bucket and like the things that are not strictly tied to like a row as it is meant to like fuel the ecosystem.

48
00:04:09,245 --> 00:04:13,885
These two are like the more row as and cack oriented.

49
00:04:13,905 --> 00:04:16,026
So that might might help you.

50
00:04:16,146 --> 00:04:21,827
Again, I actually don't care that much about you making this perfect like these.

51
00:04:24,557 --> 00:04:25,718
separations perfect.

52
00:04:25,858 --> 00:04:34,765
It's more like, here's how much money we have to spend, here's how much affiliate gets, and here's how much charmer gets, or we get when we manage the other channels.

53
00:04:37,007 --> 00:04:37,287
Okay.

54
00:04:39,348 --> 00:04:41,910
Okay, so let's just, yeah, take a stab at this.

55
00:04:43,752 --> 00:04:46,874
Let me, want me to input directly.

56
00:04:48,876 --> 00:04:54,200
Just here, here, and I'll input.

57
00:05:02,346 --> 00:05:05,548
But Chris is going to give me those numbers right now, and then I'll input them.

58
00:05:14,412 --> 00:05:14,992
How are you doing?

59
00:05:15,412 --> 00:05:16,312
Good, good, good, good.

60
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:17,393
That's something.

61
00:05:17,493 --> 00:05:19,034
It won't make sense.

62
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:21,475
Not too overwhelming, so.

63
00:05:22,495 --> 00:05:22,855
Okay.

64
00:05:22,915 --> 00:05:22,995
Cool.

65
00:05:23,015 --> 00:05:23,856
Are you good?

66
00:05:26,097 --> 00:05:26,237
Cool.

67
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,867
Um, and then I always obviously just like keep track of these efficiencies.

68
00:05:33,887 --> 00:05:42,578
Oh, my husband like unplugged my computer.

69
00:05:54,674 --> 00:06:05,422
Yeah, let's start here and then I'll create a separate conversation around, around Amazon.

70
00:06:05,442 --> 00:06:16,310
Yeah, because I noticed that I was on that weekly report, but I didn't have any like, I didn't have a tool to kind of view that performance or any log ins either.

71
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:24,956
Yeah, so Amazon, just while Chris is doing this, Amazon is interesting because we sell to a reseller.

72
00:06:25,076 --> 00:06:28,179
So we basically have like, it's run like a wholesale.

73
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:35,397
partner.

74
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:38,220
That might change.

75
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,883
I had a really good conversation with another agency.

76
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:43,844
I like this current one.

77
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:49,549
It's just the unit economics are starting to not make as much sense because it's grown it.

78
00:06:51,991 --> 00:06:56,835
So it's possible that we take it in-house but have a sort of 3P

79
00:06:58,888 --> 00:07:03,230
partner, how experienced are you on Amazon?

80
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:10,795
So I've always had partners on Amazon, never really directly managing myself, but I'm familiar with the wholesale process through talking through them.

81
00:07:12,376 --> 00:07:20,360
But they've all directly managed it and kind of handled logistics, making sure the product and stuff is there.

82
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,043
So definitely never manage it, but familiar with how it plays into the ecosystem.

83
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:26,367
Yeah.

84
00:07:26,788 --> 00:07:30,210
So I think for now, I can keep just managing it for now.

85
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,532
And then I think the D2C one is the one I need the most help with.

86
00:07:34,292 --> 00:07:35,553
So we can focus on that.

87
00:07:35,573 --> 00:07:41,296
And then I'll add you in if we make a major change or something.

88
00:07:42,217 --> 00:07:42,797
OK.

89
00:07:42,937 --> 00:07:55,645
And then I can also work on getting those CRM inputs for you for each month, because you're not going to have that.

90
00:07:56,172 --> 00:07:56,413
here.

91
00:07:56,433 --> 00:08:01,123
Cool CRM and what would the CRM

92
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,812
That's just like email and SMS.

93
00:08:04,872 --> 00:08:11,337
So we come from claveo and attentive and then we just move to post script, but that won't have any of the historicals.

94
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,779
I think a half access to the claveo and attentive.

95
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:14,760
Oh, you do.

96
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,040
Okay.

97
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:15,301
Great.

98
00:08:15,341 --> 00:08:19,064
So we're going to be good there where I can pull it from Northland to Rural.

99
00:08:19,084 --> 00:08:22,467
I mean, we want platform reported revenue, right?

100
00:08:22,487 --> 00:08:25,189
So it makes these reports the easiest.

101
00:08:25,309 --> 00:08:25,810
Definitely.

102
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:26,630
Definitely.

103
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,171
And then, um,

104
00:08:29,588 --> 00:08:45,059
The only thing with CRM, you can confirm this, but like for July, I'm pretty sure I used the Shopify reported revenue versus the Clavio because the Shopify one is the most conservative.

105
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:46,299
It's like the last click.

106
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,741
But I can't.

107
00:08:48,781 --> 00:08:51,103
How's revenue reporting for Clavio?

108
00:08:52,143 --> 00:08:52,464
Yes.

109
00:08:57,011 --> 00:08:59,753
Let me actually see what I used.

110
00:09:11,662 --> 00:09:12,783
I'm wondering if I have it here.

111
00:09:13,424 --> 00:09:19,328
There's a marketing channels report and other marketing and attribution.

112
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:21,290
Does that sound familiar?

113
00:09:22,471 --> 00:09:23,472
Oh, um, here.

114
00:09:23,612 --> 00:09:24,693
Share your screen with me here.

115
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:25,253
I'll stop sharing.

116
00:09:39,415 --> 00:09:48,162
Yes, so you can just like do Clavio just make sure that you're using all of the iterations or maybe like more than one.

117
00:09:48,182 --> 00:09:53,087
And then there's also in the analytics, there's like sales buy refer.

118
00:09:53,107 --> 00:09:57,891
But no, I think you're right with the marketing channel.

119
00:09:58,091 --> 00:09:59,112
That's going to be the cleanest.

120
00:10:04,952 --> 00:10:06,512
Marking attribution.

121
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:17,455
Yeah, I'm looking at it too on my own thing.

122
00:10:25,738 --> 00:10:27,378
There's a few different ones.

123
00:10:27,398 --> 00:10:34,180
Yeah, Marking attribution might wrap them all into one so not to filter down to it, but I'll swap in some both.

124
00:10:35,706 --> 00:10:44,571
Yeah, you can also just ask Hannah at Sharma who does our CRM.

125
00:10:50,354 --> 00:10:52,955
But I'm pretty sure I used the Shopify number.

126
00:10:54,156 --> 00:10:55,396
And I think Hannah just gave it to me.

127
00:10:55,436 --> 00:10:56,637
So yeah, here's Clevio.

128
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:07,548
Let me actually go out for computers and soul.

129
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:17,358
Hmm, last year.

130
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,601
time.

131
00:11:34,302 --> 00:11:35,422
So yeah, here we go.

132
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,465
Flavio.

133
00:11:40,846 --> 00:11:42,627
Oh, see, this is saying 90.

134
00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:43,048
Oh, right.

135
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:44,889
It would be clavio and then attentive.

136
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:59,158
So I probably did that 90 plus whatever we can get there.

137
00:11:59,218 --> 00:11:59,479
Let's see.

138
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,059
Did Christopher

139
00:12:32,883 --> 00:12:38,006
Okay, and then for these guys, let me show you guys.

140
00:12:43,254 --> 00:12:46,317
You can just use GA4 for the direct and organic.

141
00:12:46,957 --> 00:12:47,257
Okay.

142
00:12:48,979 --> 00:12:52,421
And I just pull a revenue from those channels from direct and organic.

143
00:12:53,422 --> 00:12:53,723
Okay.

144
00:12:54,944 --> 00:12:55,544
Perreference.

145
00:12:55,564 --> 00:12:56,605
Does that make sense?

146
00:12:56,705 --> 00:12:57,506
Yeah, that makes sense.

147
00:13:05,192 --> 00:13:06,353
Jordan, you're a mute.

148
00:13:08,575 --> 00:13:09,695
Yeah, no, it makes sense.

149
00:13:09,736 --> 00:13:10,176
We're good to go.

150
00:13:11,215 --> 00:13:12,857
Okay, okay, cool.

151
00:13:12,897 --> 00:13:15,760
Chris hasn't gotten back to me, but yeah, this is the exercise.

152
00:13:16,881 --> 00:13:19,924
So kind of like look at the last year and then look at this year.

153
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:27,231
And then that's also really good grounding for you too of like what basically drove each month.

154
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:31,955
We've also added a bunch of new channels and stuff like that.

155
00:13:32,035 --> 00:13:35,339
So it'll get a little bit more interesting.

156
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:41,829
I also have anesthesia, so I'm going to give the affiliate investment parts here.

157
00:13:41,849 --> 00:13:46,456
Anesthesia handles the affiliate relationships.

158
00:13:46,797 --> 00:13:47,177
Yeah.

159
00:13:47,238 --> 00:13:47,338
OK.

160
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,072
Okay, anything else you need for me?

161
00:13:53,552 --> 00:13:55,934
I just want to walk through, make sure I understand correctly.

162
00:13:56,055 --> 00:14:05,944
So looking at the worksheet or historicals to get historical data to pull in to Q1 through Q4 or Q3 through Q4 summaries.

163
00:14:07,085 --> 00:14:08,487
Looking at 2022, 2023 or 23, 24, 25 of the last three years.

164
00:14:13,271 --> 00:14:20,053
We want growth from year over year, approximately 20% is kind of what we're projecting for the future months.

165
00:14:20,473 --> 00:14:26,175
And then also looking at channel breakdown performance and getting some budgets there too.

166
00:14:26,255 --> 00:14:34,637
But what's really important is the overall budget for each quarter so that we know what we're working with.

167
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,178
Exactly, so I would start.

168
00:14:38,286 --> 00:14:39,366
here, right?

169
00:14:39,566 --> 00:14:45,367
I like go into, you'll actually have the historicals all here.

170
00:14:45,387 --> 00:15:02,151
And then we just need to, so let me actually, just to stop from being confusing, I'm going to delete this, because we don't have these actuals yet.

171
00:15:09,761 --> 00:15:18,863
And you're gonna, I wouldn't even put these actuals in here until we have them.

172
00:15:19,203 --> 00:15:23,344
So like leave this sheet just with like what really happened.

173
00:15:24,544 --> 00:15:33,166
And then use our Q2 and then the monthlies, you know, Q3, Q4 and then the monthlies for the projections.

174
00:15:34,952 --> 00:15:35,813
So you'll have this.

175
00:15:36,213 --> 00:15:42,478
I'm going to put in the actuals so that you can determine.

176
00:15:42,498 --> 00:15:42,538
OK.

177
00:15:47,222 --> 00:15:47,502
Lean.

178
00:15:47,702 --> 00:15:48,323
Good, good, good.

179
00:15:53,947 --> 00:15:56,910
And this is also set up by PPC and affiliate.

180
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:57,750
This is so annoying.

181
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:58,451
This is old.

182
00:16:00,853 --> 00:16:03,355
You're really actually going to do, it's this one.

183
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:09,328
a combined is this breaks up to oops.

184
00:16:27,046 --> 00:16:28,327
Because this is really what you need.

185
00:16:34,821 --> 00:16:37,562
sales and then combine spend.

186
00:16:37,582 --> 00:16:49,605
You may end up wanting to recreate this really.

187
00:16:50,065 --> 00:16:50,505
I don't know.

188
00:16:51,526 --> 00:16:52,866
Sorry, I'm thinking about this out loud.

189
00:17:17,785 --> 00:17:19,913
Chris went in to all these stupid formulas.

190
00:18:30,098 --> 00:18:38,961
And then actually what maybe we're missing here is like here to date on these quarterly ones because this will be your summary.

191
00:18:41,104 --> 00:18:47,128
sales, spend, percent of gold.

192
00:18:47,148 --> 00:18:51,911
Are you filming?

193
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,713
Yeah.

194
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:59,816
So you're going to try to fix how close or far are we?

195
00:19:00,196 --> 00:19:01,717
You'll need all the summaries.

196
00:19:08,331 --> 00:19:19,000
And then just in terms of like projection language versus actuals, whenever you do a projection, just put in a different color or like highlight the cell or something like that.

197
00:19:19,101 --> 00:19:20,121
So it just keeps it clean.

198
00:19:23,624 --> 00:19:31,852
And then we'll probably just need one of these for each month within that quarter.

199
00:19:31,872 --> 00:19:34,334
Let me just make them now.

200
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:15,967
And you for these the individual month ones you just need 24 and there you don't need 23.

201
00:20:45,489 --> 00:20:47,410
And then this is what we get to Sharma too.

202
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:27,060
that everything I do is now just make sense.

203
00:21:38,663 --> 00:21:50,227
I only started this in June because we were like ramping up and everything was kind of chaotic, but now it'll help.

204
00:21:52,952 --> 00:21:53,152
Okay.

205
00:21:53,873 --> 00:21:54,715
I think we're good.

206
00:21:54,735 --> 00:21:55,696
Let's check if Chris.

207
00:21:56,097 --> 00:21:56,757
No, we are all right.

208
00:21:56,818 --> 00:21:58,139
I'll just put it in when Chris ends it.

209
00:21:58,961 --> 00:21:59,842
Sounds good.

210
00:21:59,882 --> 00:22:02,205
Let me know when that's when.

211
00:22:02,365 --> 00:22:03,387
Thank you.

212
00:22:04,228 --> 00:22:04,508
All right.

213
00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:05,129
Talk soon.

214
00:22:05,209 --> 00:22:05,830
I'll go.
