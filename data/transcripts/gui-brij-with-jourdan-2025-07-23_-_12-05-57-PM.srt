1
00:00:00,129 --> 00:00:03,250
which is also why I think Sarah touched on this too, right?

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,031
The digital activation goes so far.

3
00:00:05,091 --> 00:00:11,254
We just take those those experiences that we build up for you guys and then those live on your socials.

4
00:00:11,374 --> 00:00:14,655
Those can get funneled into your meta ads and your Google ads.

5
00:00:14,675 --> 00:00:24,979
So that way when people go on Facebook or Instagram, higher doses popping up everywhere and it's directing them right to those virtual experiences where you know they can shop directly from those experiences.

6
00:00:24,999 --> 00:00:26,260
So we're driving revenue from there.

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,622
we're able to educate folks because people are curious, right?

8
00:00:31,742 --> 00:00:34,883
If they're on higher dose for the first time, they're like, oh, what the heck is this product?

9
00:00:34,903 --> 00:00:35,804
What's it going to do for me?

10
00:00:36,204 --> 00:00:44,408
Even just being able to educate someone immediately from that ad will lead into revenue being driven, right?

11
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:51,911
So activating from a digital standpoint, I'm glad you see the value there because that's where we're going to be the stickiest early on until

12
00:00:52,873 --> 00:00:56,837
We collaborate together because again, we've been in this space for a while.

13
00:00:56,997 --> 00:00:58,638
We like to think that we're the experts here.

14
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:09,629
So when it comes to putting QR codes on packaging and getting a call to action in place, like what's going to drive somebody to scan a QR code, right?

15
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,050
What's going to get them to register?

16
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:11,290
But

17
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:29,070
That's when the collaboration comes into play and allowing us to kind of steer the ship on like, Hey, this is how we're going to drive the most conversions and the most scans for you guys once those QR codes, you know, really hit the wild right or the packaging has to change or whatever that may be so.

18
00:01:29,571 --> 00:01:32,214
Does that kind of resonate or did I kind of just go off?

19
00:01:32,254 --> 00:01:35,797
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

20
00:01:50,252 --> 00:01:55,176
I guess on your pricing model, how does that work?

21
00:01:55,256 --> 00:01:59,159
Are you collecting a percentage of revenue that's driven through those rich experiences?

22
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,323
I haven't dived in deep on the pricing structure, so I'm curious.

23
00:02:05,945 --> 00:02:08,348
Typically, I would demo and then dive into pricing.

24
00:02:08,908 --> 00:02:11,271
I could tell you're a laid back dude.

25
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:12,452
I'm going to flip-flop it.

26
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:17,657
I'll do pricing first and then I'll take you through a demo because I'm on a sound no BS.

27
00:02:17,697 --> 00:02:21,882
So I'd rather just kind of give you that first and then we could dive into the demo after.

28
00:02:22,522 --> 00:02:25,343
Um, but we're super transparent when it comes to pricing.

29
00:02:25,403 --> 00:02:28,284
So I'm just going to share the, I'm going to share the deck with you.

30
00:02:28,424 --> 00:02:30,504
So you can see this is what pricing looks like.

31
00:02:30,685 --> 00:02:33,465
So you have our, our standard plan, which is 1300 a month.

32
00:02:34,226 --> 00:02:37,126
Um, and then you have our pro plan, which is $2,000 a month.

33
00:02:37,627 --> 00:02:44,129
The main differentiators between pro and standard with pro, you get meta in Google Analytics integration.

34
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:44,889
So

35
00:02:46,161 --> 00:02:58,663
what we were talking about on the last call with trauma brands as well as we can take all of the data that we're capturing offline and we're feeding that back into meta in your Google Analytics, which obviously you guys are running 88 ads.

36
00:02:59,423 --> 00:03:01,084
That's a ton of money being spent.

37
00:03:01,824 --> 00:03:12,146
You want to make sure that you're exhausting every additional avenue outside of D to C and funneling that data back into those ads because you want to get the most out of your ad spending.

38
00:03:12,746 --> 00:03:13,746
And then aside from that,

39
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:19,312
You get a dedicated account manager that's basically handling all the campaigns for you.

40
00:03:19,412 --> 00:03:19,612
Sure.

41
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:23,413
You guys can build them all out and sure you have a million other things going on.

42
00:03:23,493 --> 00:03:30,595
But we have a customer success team that's handling your account, building up the experiences and really just keeping everything tipped up.

43
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:32,356
Those are the main differentiators.

44
00:03:33,896 --> 00:03:40,498
But given how many, if you guys weren't spending so much on meta ads and Google Analytics, I would say stick with the standard, but given

45
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,932
the money that you're funneling into those, I would recommend the pro.

46
00:03:44,952 --> 00:03:46,453
But again, these are the two plans that we have.

47
00:03:46,573 --> 00:03:49,976
Now, how that works is there's a two month set up fee.

48
00:03:50,216 --> 00:03:53,338
They're equivalent to that monthly payment.

49
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:56,820
But because you guys are coming through Sharma, we're going to waive that set up fee.

50
00:03:57,241 --> 00:03:58,422
So there's no set up fee there.

51
00:03:59,342 --> 00:04:00,643
And that's a $4,000 savings.

52
00:04:01,424 --> 00:04:06,987
And then where you will do a 10% discount because you're coming through Sharma as well.

53
00:04:07,308 --> 00:04:08,228
So pay that.

54
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:10,316
Monthly.

55
00:04:10,336 --> 00:04:14,162
Pro would be basically 1800 a month and then the standard would be 1100 a month.

56
00:04:22,227 --> 00:04:24,368
And then how long does that discount?

57
00:04:24,468 --> 00:04:26,129
Is that like ongoing drop relationship?

58
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:27,470
Like a forever discount?

59
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,030
Is it like the first month, two months?

60
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:29,971
How long does that last?

61
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:31,652
No, no, no, sorry.

62
00:04:31,692 --> 00:04:34,653
So the so it's we signed on a 12 month contract.

63
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:41,676
So how it would work is it would be a 12 month contract and that 10% discount would live through the entire 12 month cycle.

64
00:04:42,096 --> 00:04:42,276
Right.

65
00:04:42,576 --> 00:04:43,117
Yeah.

66
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:45,258
So that would be the 1800 for the

67
00:04:48,959 --> 00:05:00,965
for the 12 months, or if you guys wanted to pay for the 12 months upfront, we could figure out something else on top of that to make it a little bit more reasonable for you guys to sign that 12 months upfront.

68
00:05:01,665 --> 00:05:03,045
Yeah, okay.

69
00:05:03,146 --> 00:05:05,106
But it's 12 months regardless, right?

70
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:08,728
Whether you're doing month-to-month or paying annually, you're in a 12 month contract.

71
00:05:09,554 --> 00:05:09,754
Yeah.

72
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:10,455
Correct.

73
00:05:10,575 --> 00:05:10,976
Exactly.

74
00:05:11,116 --> 00:05:15,983
But Kate and your CMO are connected, right?

75
00:05:16,123 --> 00:05:18,105
Or their friends are somewhere along those lines?

76
00:05:18,706 --> 00:05:19,167
Possibly.

77
00:05:19,247 --> 00:05:19,948
I don't know.

78
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,171
I don't have to circle back with England.

79
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:22,812
Yeah.

80
00:05:22,952 --> 00:05:23,332
Yeah.

81
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:23,893
Yeah.

82
00:05:24,955 --> 00:05:27,477
Okay, I think, yeah, I think Ingrid and Kate are connected.

83
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,539
Again, given it's a, it's a personal relationship there.

84
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:39,525
If we needed to do like a two month opt out or something, we could, we could work that into into the contract as well, but typically yes, it is a 12 month commitment.

85
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:52,473
But given there's some ramp outside of digital, we can work some sort of like opt out, you know, to give you guys a little bit more of a safe playing field, implementing something like bridge.

86
00:05:53,014 --> 00:05:53,214
Yeah.

87
00:05:55,495 --> 00:06:19,905
Yeah, given coming from from Sharma that that obviously helps within the personal relationship also we want to make sure that we're getting the best brands on our portfolio and then you know obviously we're trying to help you guys out however we can as well so yeah 10% discount and then the the opt out and we can kind of figure out what that opt out works right if if we need two months three months we can we can figure out the nitty gritty there

88
00:06:20,365 --> 00:06:21,026
Awesome.

89
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:22,647
I appreciate the transparency, man.

90
00:06:22,687 --> 00:06:23,768
Thanks for diving into that.

91
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:30,334
Yeah, I just was curious, you know, especially obviously you guys got a very robust platform.

92
00:06:30,374 --> 00:06:37,121
So a lot of people have different models and just curious, but what we jump into the demo got a lot of curiosity there as well.

93
00:06:38,007 --> 00:06:43,711
Yeah, and then out of curiosity too, as far as like the pricing goes, does that kind of align with where you guys are at?

94
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:47,413
Is that side of the scope would love to hear your transparency there too?

95
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:53,177
Yeah, so honestly, I'm not too sure on what the budget would be for a tool like this or like what our tool budget is.

96
00:06:53,297 --> 00:06:54,958
I do under like no, our marketing budget.

97
00:06:55,399 --> 00:07:02,183
From what we have allocated towards add dollars, I'd say, you know, 18 for the year might be, well, not bad.

98
00:07:02,203 --> 00:07:03,284
18 hundred a month not bad.

99
00:07:03,884 --> 00:07:06,826
So personally, my personal opinion, I don't feel like that's

100
00:07:09,528 --> 00:07:13,530
out of the expectation I do anticipate tools like this that you're on in that price range.

101
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:23,576
So, but yeah, ultimately going to come down to Ingrid and I'd imagine if she is connected with, you know, someone on your team, then she's kind of where going into it.

102
00:07:23,596 --> 00:07:25,357
So I don't think there's going to be any sticker shop.

103
00:07:26,198 --> 00:07:36,304
Yeah, and also, and I've been sending these figures after, but one thing to keep in a consideration too is given the like the space that you're in in Durable Goods, we're averaging right now.

104
00:07:36,937 --> 00:07:42,167
around like a 30 to 40% registration rate with the QR codes currently.

105
00:07:42,768 --> 00:07:48,338
And per profile that we're generating, we're averaging about 85 through 100 dollars per profile collected.

106
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:49,199
So.

107
00:07:50,976 --> 00:07:51,776
see in 30 to 40%.

108
00:07:52,457 --> 00:08:00,639
If we talk extremely conservative figures at a 10% conversion rate, the ROI there, I'm happy to send you over our ROI calculator and you can play with it.

109
00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:08,122
And I'll put in extremely conservative figures, but even at an $18,000 contract, you can easily 10, 20X through return.

110
00:08:08,902 --> 00:08:18,205
Again, extremely, extremely conservative figures, but I can send that over to you so you can show England like, hey, we're paying this much, but these figures are,

111
00:08:19,113 --> 00:08:24,914
You know, way lower than what they're used to seeing, just so you can kind of see the return and obviously build up that use case, right?

112
00:08:24,954 --> 00:08:25,874
That would be awesome.

113
00:08:26,054 --> 00:08:27,035
I appreciate that.

114
00:08:27,095 --> 00:08:30,855
Definitely on the calculate will be good and then even like they're considered to break down.

115
00:08:31,576 --> 00:08:33,876
Um, just so I can communicate that to her.

116
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,937
Do you know, do you know what your AOV is currently?

117
00:08:37,297 --> 00:08:40,157
It's around like $500, like $500 to $600 and that range.

118
00:08:40,977 --> 00:08:44,878
And then I just want to fill it out really quick just so that where I have it on the back end.

119
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,519
And then roughly how many units per order are going, are you guys seeing right now?

120
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:51,081
Well, that was a great question.

121
00:08:51,161 --> 00:08:52,421
I did have to do that.

122
00:08:53,402 --> 00:08:57,925
What's the easy way for me to let me ask?

123
00:09:00,247 --> 00:09:01,248
Give me one second.

124
00:09:01,448 --> 00:09:02,789
Yeah, yeah, no, no worries.

125
00:09:02,869 --> 00:09:04,330
I would rather you see this now.

126
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:10,574
So that way, you know, you have all the the towing.

127
00:09:11,392 --> 00:09:14,853
to bring back to Ingrid, but if not, I can send it over you.

128
00:09:14,893 --> 00:09:20,914
I don't want you to harp on this or think that it's crazy, but I can also make a copy of the ROI calculator and send it over to you.

129
00:09:21,114 --> 00:09:21,834
Then you can fill it out.

130
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:26,255
Yeah, yeah, that might be because it definitely have access to the data to get that.

131
00:09:26,615 --> 00:09:30,815
Don't know the number on hand, but I can when you see if I can.

132
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:31,395
Yeah, I do.

133
00:09:32,516 --> 00:09:33,076
Quick search.

134
00:09:34,396 --> 00:09:34,616
Yeah.

135
00:09:52,028 --> 00:09:53,629
And then the demo won't take a long.

136
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:55,029
We can get through it in like 10 minutes.

137
00:09:55,289 --> 00:09:56,790
So don't worry, don't sort it there.

138
00:10:30,851 --> 00:10:32,252
I'm going to send this to your email right now.

139
00:10:32,272 --> 00:10:38,217
I'm going to share access with you so you can see it.

140
00:10:42,581 --> 00:10:50,007
I just sent it over to you, but there's a few things to fill out like AOV units for order, your annual revenue, how many total units you think you're going to sell.

141
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:55,013
And then of those total units, how many you're anticipating will be offline.

142
00:10:55,713 --> 00:10:58,814
The registration rate, like I said, we average 30 to 40%.

143
00:10:59,634 --> 00:11:05,336
We can leave a conservative figure at like 10% to keep it extremely, extremely low.

144
00:11:05,397 --> 00:11:08,258
Again, that's 20 or 30% lower than what we're typically seeing.

145
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:15,160
And then estimated revenue per profile were averaging 85 to $100 per profile collected.

146
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,201
If we bump that number down to like

147
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,184
$50 per profile, which is about half of what we're generating right now.

148
00:11:21,684 --> 00:11:23,065
We can play off of those figures.

149
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,684
just so you can see what the ROI looks like that we're driving back D to C or, you know, to the other channels that you're looking for.

150
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:33,406
But I pretty much like filled in half the information.

151
00:11:33,846 --> 00:11:35,067
I just need the nitty gritty for me.

152
00:11:36,828 --> 00:11:37,088
Cool.

153
00:11:37,348 --> 00:11:45,914
So then diving a little bit, you know, backwards into what we went into the other day as far as, like, these are the experiences that we're going to build up for you guys, right?

154
00:11:46,374 --> 00:11:51,458
And we can build out these experiences specifically to different skis that you guys are selling.

155
00:11:51,618 --> 00:11:58,840
So if you want them for a specific product that you have, there's no limit within that pricing that I sent over to you.

156
00:11:59,161 --> 00:12:02,542
You can build out, you and your team can build out as many as you need to.

157
00:12:02,562 --> 00:12:07,523
And you can run a hundred different campaigns if you really want to.

158
00:12:07,764 --> 00:12:12,445
And then having that account manager on board will be there to facilitate building those out.

159
00:12:12,845 --> 00:12:14,726
But diving a little deeper.

160
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:20,071
Being integrated with Shopify, we can extract all those assets directly into here.

161
00:12:20,651 --> 00:12:23,773
And then as you're building these out, everything is drag and drop.

162
00:12:24,274 --> 00:12:32,580
So if there are certain things that are interesting to you or you want to build into these workflows, you simply just drag drop and then start creating from there.

163
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:49,067
Link, for example, if you want a link to a specific page on your website, if you're doing anything influencer or event activation, we can drag and drop anything into these workflows and build them up really however you want.

164
00:12:49,127 --> 00:12:51,908
The call to action right now is registering your product for a warranty.

165
00:12:52,508 --> 00:12:56,850
So right here, we would activate with email and then we're capturing that first party data from there.

166
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:01,512
But then, as I mentioned the other day, you can shop directly from these experiences,

167
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:06,979
and then learn a little bit more as well as you kind of go on driving reviews, whatever it may be.

168
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:07,800
I'll stop here.

169
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,963
Just want to pick your brain on what kind of flows do you think would resonate the most for you guys, right?

170
00:13:15,143 --> 00:13:18,565
Um, obviously shopping experience, the register registration of the product.

171
00:13:18,805 --> 00:13:19,986
Um, I'm not.

172
00:13:21,006 --> 00:13:22,687
I'm sure that would be valuable to us.

173
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:23,527
Obviously it's valuable.

174
00:13:23,547 --> 00:13:24,368
A lot of other companies.

175
00:13:25,668 --> 00:13:32,452
I would say maybe not so much book or treatment or the brand likes it.

176
00:13:32,532 --> 00:13:39,235
I don't know how diverse the locations or I guess our retail partners are that own like net spotting stuff like that.

177
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:43,077
For it to like make sense for that call action while I show you.

178
00:13:43,897 --> 00:13:46,579
If that doesn't make sense, pop it out and it's gone forever.

179
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:50,202
And how it just goes to show how easy it is to build these things up.

180
00:13:50,222 --> 00:13:51,223
But anyway, sorry to cut you off.

181
00:13:51,403 --> 00:13:52,044
Yeah, I'm good.

182
00:13:52,084 --> 00:13:52,444
You're good.

183
00:13:52,684 --> 00:13:57,448
And I mean, there could be like other initiatives like how to use the product.

184
00:13:57,508 --> 00:14:05,194
I know we're just on the team call and some of the FAQ questions that are coming through customer service was kind of like how it turns certain products on.

185
00:14:05,234 --> 00:14:10,198
So there could be, you know, product and use videos, demonstration level videos that will help.

186
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:16,784
reduce the amount of, like, a strain on customer service by having that information, like, readily available in an experience like this.

187
00:14:17,364 --> 00:14:24,310
And I guess my follow-up question for you is, where do you see brands excelling the most with these placement?

188
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,812
Like, where are they placing these?

189
00:14:26,252 --> 00:14:33,357
bridge experiences within their ecosystem, obviously their socials, their leveraging them and paid media to some extent.

190
00:14:33,377 --> 00:14:41,083
So I'm curious, I guess what placements are you seeing these bridge experiences be most successful?

191
00:14:41,103 --> 00:14:43,645
Yeah, that's a fantastic question.

192
00:14:45,453 --> 00:14:52,835
All of the above is really the best answer wherever you can put a bridge experiences is that is where we're going to be the stickiest.

193
00:14:52,895 --> 00:15:01,398
So obviously starting with socials, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, if you guys have a page, obviously those are the most trafficked avenues.

194
00:15:02,904 --> 00:15:04,065
everywhere in the world right now.

195
00:15:04,826 --> 00:15:07,448
So taking this link right here, right?

196
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:10,090
This is the actual like bridge link.

197
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,474
You click that link, it'll take you directly to the bridge experience.

198
00:15:14,934 --> 00:15:23,342
You copy and paste that link, but with the pro plan, what we do is we can change the domain name so it reflects higher dose.

199
00:15:23,562 --> 00:15:25,343
So it's not anything bridge branded.

200
00:15:25,464 --> 00:15:26,585
It's all higher dose branded.

201
00:15:27,545 --> 00:15:29,446
and that would live on your social.

202
00:15:29,506 --> 00:15:38,469
So if you guys have a link tree right now, we can do whatever is in that link tree, we can just build it into the bridge experience flow.

203
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:41,189
So don't think like, hey, we have a link tree now.

204
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:42,750
It takes you to all these different places.

205
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:43,510
Fantastic.

206
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:50,672
We can build that into the experience while giving you everything else, the shopping, the education, whatever you need them to be.

207
00:15:50,872 --> 00:15:52,293
But to answer your question,

208
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:56,953
living in your socials, but then also taking it a step further.

209
00:15:58,054 --> 00:16:06,602
Those meta in Google ads, once we're capturing that data, we can build out these bridge experiences to be directly in Facebook or Instagram ads.

210
00:16:06,702 --> 00:16:12,967
So someone sees an ad for higher dose on their Instagram or Facebook and they click on that ad, it'll take them directly to a bridge experience.

211
00:16:13,327 --> 00:16:14,448
And now they're able to shop.

212
00:16:14,548 --> 00:16:18,412
Now they're able to get that education or those points that you were talking to.

213
00:16:19,252 --> 00:16:33,423
Yeah, in your follow up, if you have any, I guess case studies of brands leveraging that, I'd be very curious to see what their experience was, terms of results, because it becomes like another winning page experience of what, then a sense.

214
00:16:34,104 --> 00:16:36,806
So yeah, I would be very curious to see how it plays out.

215
00:16:36,826 --> 00:16:47,054
Because even with warm audiences, people who have bought products, we can push them to register the product and then upsell them to products that we know would be complimentary to what they've already bought.

216
00:16:48,078 --> 00:17:00,048
So we can get that cross-selling, upselling journey started sooner than later through paid ads or through email and allowing people to click these bridge experiences for them to register their product as a follow-up email.

217
00:17:00,428 --> 00:17:06,433
And depending on the product that they bought, the bridge experience will change so that it's aligned with the next consumable upsell.

218
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:11,938
That product can be featured in this video overlay, like even though they're obviously registered for a different one.

219
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,300
However, maybe there's just a lot of ideas following on how

220
00:17:15,542 --> 00:17:25,744
So we're putting people through a unique experience based on a product that previously bought, allowing them to register, encouraging them to register in a product.

221
00:17:26,965 --> 00:17:34,048
shop for others or learn more about how the users are existing product and all those links are available in one spot.

222
00:17:34,468 --> 00:17:45,351
I think also having that warranty registration goes such a long way because there are a lot of brands out there that we work with that don't necessarily have a powerful call to action and then we have to get extremely creative.

223
00:17:45,391 --> 00:17:48,452
I'm like, okay, how are we going to get someone to scan the QR code?

224
00:17:48,973 --> 00:17:49,673
If I buy

225
00:17:50,373 --> 00:17:56,398
A five hundred dollar product and they're offering a one year warranty why aren't I gonna register for it, right?

226
00:17:57,219 --> 00:18:04,104
So I'm just saying that that goes a long way compared to a lot of other brands that we're working with that don't have much to give away, right?

227
00:18:04,204 --> 00:18:05,445
That's already powerful enough.

228
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:07,366
Stack that with a few more things.

229
00:18:07,847 --> 00:18:11,530
That's what's really going to drive those registration those registration rates.

230
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:12,430
So

231
00:18:13,823 --> 00:18:17,364
diving a little bit into the back end of the platform, like the knitting ready.

232
00:18:17,424 --> 00:18:18,864
So you can see what this looks like.

233
00:18:19,324 --> 00:18:21,825
This is again, a campaign that we're running right now.

234
00:18:22,005 --> 00:18:27,486
Feel free to stop me at any point, but happy to dive deeper into any of these like subcategories.

235
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:33,308
And then if I went over any of this on the last call, feel free to just let me know, but.

236
00:18:34,728 --> 00:18:36,650
Essentially, you're able to track all of this.

237
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:41,555
You can set start dates and dates track by individual campaigns.

238
00:18:41,755 --> 00:18:53,166
So as you're running different experiences and different geographical locations, you can see, okay, this campaign is working really well in Massachusetts or this one's working really well in California, right?

239
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:59,392
So tracking those scans and clicks, how many of those are converting into actual registrations,

240
00:19:00,543 --> 00:19:03,546
And then how many times are people clicking through those bridge experiences?

241
00:19:03,687 --> 00:19:08,632
And then again, I think we talked about this quickly on the last call, the revenue attribution.

242
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:18,564
So indirect revenue, the moment we capture that first party data at any point, the customer makes contact with your product and we capture that data.

243
00:19:19,004 --> 00:19:20,486
If they come back at any point,

244
00:19:21,332 --> 00:19:26,755
and check out with that email or that phone number, we're attributing that to indirect revenue, right?

245
00:19:26,775 --> 00:19:29,076
So it's a way to track it, but not as direct.

246
00:19:29,617 --> 00:19:40,363
But being on Shopify, if someone checks out and makes a purchase of an additional product through that bridge experience, we're attributing that to direct revenue.

247
00:19:40,443 --> 00:19:44,685
So it's coming directly from within a bridge experience, and we're able to track all of that, all right?

248
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:48,067
Taking it a step further,

249
00:19:49,352 --> 00:19:49,993
registrations.

250
00:19:50,654 --> 00:19:53,097
So people are registering for warranties.

251
00:19:53,157 --> 00:19:57,342
You can see exactly their profiles who they are and get all the information on them.

252
00:19:57,642 --> 00:20:06,413
So where they stand and then kind of the flow that they were taken to until that kind of approval happens and they're registered for your product.

253
00:20:08,694 --> 00:20:09,695
What else we got?

254
00:20:09,715 --> 00:20:25,360
You've seen the most congruency from people that have bought retail and are looking to register their products with bridge experiences, like as far as registration go, or is it do you think the registrations are being driven from like social placements or paid media placements in your personal opinion?

255
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:42,437
Yeah, I would say the paid media part or like the paid ad part, the reason why it makes so much sense there and why we're seeing so much successes because brands are spending so much money on meta in Google Analytics anyways, and then think of it as like a battery, right?

256
00:20:43,037 --> 00:20:45,019
Your meta ads are like

257
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:55,572
picture at a full battery of like 100% and right now, if a company's D to C presence is 20%, you're only feeding, met a 20% of that like full capability.

258
00:20:56,012 --> 00:21:01,553
Now, partnered with everything else they were able to do, were able to drive registration, which is customer stickiness, right?

259
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,274
That's good customer retention, that's driving repeat customer.

260
00:21:04,374 --> 00:21:12,376
But you're also taking all of that data that you never had before and funneling into the biggest marketing spend that you guys currently have right now.

261
00:21:14,557 --> 00:21:18,782
living on socials, the product registration, it all pretty much comes full circle.

262
00:21:20,284 --> 00:21:22,606
If that kind of answers your question, right?

263
00:21:22,626 --> 00:21:22,786
Yeah.

264
00:21:23,888 --> 00:21:23,968
Yeah.

265
00:21:23,988 --> 00:21:24,168
Okay.

266
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:24,809
Cool.

267
00:21:25,329 --> 00:21:30,135
And then diving into like serialized codes.

268
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:30,635
I don't know.

269
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,838
Did we talk on this last conversation?

270
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,539
I don't think so.

271
00:21:35,578 --> 00:21:49,868
So basically, serialized codes is if you if your products have individual serial numbers on them, which I don't know if they do or if that's something that you plan to roll out with your higher ticketed items, we can tie those directly to a skew.

272
00:21:50,188 --> 00:21:56,753
So you can see who's registering them where they're activating them to just keep a closer look on those individual serial numbers.

273
00:21:57,353 --> 00:22:06,175
This is typically for higher ticketed items like Gosley, the pizza oven that we're working with right now, they sell $2,000 pizza oven, but everything's skewed or everything is serialized.

274
00:22:06,515 --> 00:22:11,215
So it's an easier way to be able to track the interactions between the skews and the serial numbers.

275
00:22:11,535 --> 00:22:20,117
I don't know if you guys are doing this, but it's just an added layer of being able to track where those specific serial numbers are.

276
00:22:20,497 --> 00:22:24,218
Again, don't know if that really resonates with you guys, but figured I'd throw that out there.

277
00:22:24,998 --> 00:22:25,338
And then,

278
00:22:26,485 --> 00:22:27,186
the orders tab.

279
00:22:27,726 --> 00:22:47,422
So this is basically when someone is checking out directly from within a bridge experience, we're able to track those orders and then be exactly where they're coming from, how much these folks are ordering and kind of what their buying patterns are and then feeding all that data back into your email marketing stack as well.

280
00:22:47,442 --> 00:22:53,026
You know, this person bought XYZ at this time, you know, and then build both campaigns from there.

281
00:22:53,187 --> 00:22:53,987
I'll kind of stop there.

282
00:22:54,007 --> 00:22:55,989
That was a lot that I threw at you.

283
00:22:56,229 --> 00:22:57,950
Yeah, we appreciate the context.

284
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,011
Thank you for diving in.

285
00:22:59,592 --> 00:23:01,813
Question following this orders conversation.

286
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:05,216
Do you guys have integrations with like meta for syncing audiences?

287
00:23:05,236 --> 00:23:10,940
So if I want to pass back some of this order data from bridge specifically, I know I can do that to what clavio as well.

288
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:22,529
I build an audience segment based off of the tag discount code or other tag things here to get that in the meta, but I'm just curious if you guys have any features directly within bridge.

289
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:23,900
Yeah, we do.

290
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:24,341
Yep.

291
00:23:24,421 --> 00:23:28,507
So all of that is attributed directly in so we can we can integrate that all over.

292
00:23:28,527 --> 00:23:29,168
Yeah.

293
00:23:29,388 --> 00:23:29,628
Nice.

294
00:23:29,849 --> 00:23:30,169
Awesome.

295
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:30,850
Yeah.

296
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:35,918
Definitely love leveraging this third party data in any way possible.

297
00:23:38,415 --> 00:23:45,599
And yeah, I think that especially in my last screen, we'll look like audiences and quality-seed audiences and we're marketing.

298
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:50,121
So anybody that bought your bridge experience, you can continue to segment and market to them in different ways.

299
00:23:50,181 --> 00:23:51,762
So all right.

300
00:23:52,162 --> 00:24:06,910
And then I don't know what you guys are doing as far as like influencer activation or event activation, but if you're doing stuff around influencers, once they're advertising the product out to their fan base or whoever it may be,

301
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:11,892
They simply plug and play that bridge experience as well when they're linking to their customers.

302
00:24:11,972 --> 00:24:14,293
Now folks can purchase directly from there as well.

303
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:17,795
So that's where the influencer play comes in, right?

304
00:24:17,815 --> 00:24:22,298
And lives experiences like based on their own personal brand, which would be really cool for them too.

305
00:24:23,214 --> 00:24:23,694
Exactly.

306
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:24,914
We can build all that out.

307
00:24:24,955 --> 00:24:32,977
So it gets extremely customizable, depending on the influencer, depending on the products that you're sending to them and they're advertising to their folks, we build all that out.

308
00:24:33,017 --> 00:24:39,539
So again, that's a quicker way for us to implement the digital side of things before we get the actual QR codes rolled out.

309
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:40,159
Okay.

310
00:24:40,639 --> 00:24:40,799
Yes.

311
00:24:40,899 --> 00:24:41,219
All right.

312
00:24:41,999 --> 00:24:43,380
I do have a hard stuff at 1230.

313
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:43,960
Yeah.

314
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,480
Me too.

315
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:44,860
Yeah.

316
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,380
Cool.

317
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:45,660
Yeah.

318
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,060
We're both.

319
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,121
All right.

320
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:47,481
Yeah.

321
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:48,121
Appreciate it.

322
00:24:48,161 --> 00:24:51,822
I mean, any closing statements you want to make or anything else you want to close along.

323
00:24:52,893 --> 00:25:01,096
Now, I think the only thing is like, I would love to get the ROI or those nitty gritty numbers from you so we can plug into the ROI because that's where you're going to see the real value.

324
00:25:01,616 --> 00:25:08,859
And I have full confidence that if we use extremely low figures compared to our historical data, you're still going to be able to see the returns.

325
00:25:09,939 --> 00:25:15,861
Now, just out of curiosity, one would make sense for us to kind of follow up on this conversation.

326
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:17,982
I'm going to send you a follow up later today, but

327
00:25:18,482 --> 00:25:19,805
Monday, Monday should be good.

328
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:21,148
Erid's back today.

329
00:25:21,168 --> 00:25:22,711
I'm actually about to, that's my next call.

330
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:24,835
It's talking to her, but that should be interesting.

331
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:27,079
I've timed around Robin with a few other party.

332
00:25:27,219 --> 00:25:27,961
Good stuff.

333
00:25:28,221 --> 00:25:29,343
And follow up with you.

334
00:25:30,302 --> 00:25:34,446
I will I'll throw out something tentative on Monday.

335
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:36,748
I only have like a few openings.

336
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,249
I'm going to send you out two o'clock Eastern.

337
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:42,012
If that works, let me know if not my Tuesday is wide open.

338
00:25:42,092 --> 00:25:43,814
So happy to reconvene there too.

339
00:25:44,174 --> 00:25:44,354
Cool.

340
00:25:44,554 --> 00:25:45,095
Sounds good, man.

341
00:25:45,115 --> 00:25:45,535
Appreciate it.

342
00:25:46,276 --> 00:25:46,536
I do.

343
00:25:46,556 --> 00:25:47,036
Thanks so much.

344
00:25:47,437 --> 00:25:47,517
Bye.
