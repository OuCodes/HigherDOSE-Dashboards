- **Top three products** (PEMF Pro Mat, Red Light Hat, Sauna Blanket) account for 36% of July revenue ($444k) and show 76-87% NTB penetration – proven hero SKUs for acquisition.
- **Strong profitability:** July Rev-to-Net of $867k indicates paid media added substantial contribution margin after $361k total spend, achieving 3.40 blended ROAS.

## Strategic Recommendations

- **Scale what’s working:** Increase Google Ads budgets by 20% and test additional non-brand keywords; double down on Awin partnerships (3.31 ROAS) while reassessing ShopMyShelf influencer selection criteria.
- **Fix / trim under-performers:** Cut the bottom 30 % of Meta/TikTok ad sets by spend; refresh creative with product-led testimonials and evergreen offers before re-scaling.
- **Leverage hero SKUs:** Center Q3 campaigns around PEMF Pro Mat + Red-Light bundles; layer limited-time gift-with-purchase to sustain 80 %+ NTB mix.
- **Bundle & upsell returning shoppers:** Deploy email/SMS automations promoting accessory starter kits (high repeat propensity, 70 %+ NTB) – no additional media cost.
- **Explore Pinterest Shopping & Performance Max for Bing:** Low incremental spend could add $10 k-$15 k revenue at 3 + ROAS based on current CPC benchmarks.
- **Improve channel tracking:** Ensure GA UTM governance for AppLovin & Referral sources to reduce “Other” bucket, enabling clearer budget decisions.
