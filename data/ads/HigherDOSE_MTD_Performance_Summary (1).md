## Key Insights

- Paid Search (Google/Bing) generated over 50% of paid-media revenue at 2.7 ROAS and the lowest CAC – strong head-room for additional budget.
- **Affiliate performance is mixed:** Awin delivered exceptional results ($160k revenue, 3.71 ROAS) while ShopMyShelf underperformed (1.29 ROAS). Organic referrals from TikTok ($6.6k), Later ($4.8k), and Shopify ($13.6k) generated $25k with zero spend.
- Paid Social (Meta/IG) & TikTok consumed 45 % of spend but returned < 0.5 ROAS, pulling blended performance down; creative fatigue and promo-heavy CPC spikes visible in GA.
- New-customer mix remains high at 63 %, helped by PEMF/Red-Light launches; returning revenue is concentrated in accessories/bundles.
- Top three products (PEMF Pro Mat, Red Light Hat, Sauna Blanket) account for 37 % of July revenue and show 74 – 88 % NTB penetration – hero SKUs for acquisition.
- July Rev-to-Net of $322 k indicates paid media added positive contribution margin after spend.

## Strategic Recommendations

- **Scale what’s working:** Increase Paid-Search budgets (incl. Bing) by 20 % and test additional non-brand keywords; double down on Awin partnerships (3.71 ROAS) while reassessing ShopMyShelf influencer selection criteria.
- **Fix / trim under-performers:** Cut the bottom 30 % of Meta/TikTok ad sets by spend; refresh creative with product-led testimonials and evergreen offers before re-scaling.
- **Leverage hero SKUs:** Center Q3 campaigns around PEMF Pro Mat + Red-Light bundles; layer limited-time gift-with-purchase to sustain 80 %+ NTB mix.
- **Bundle & upsell returning shoppers:** Deploy email/SMS automations promoting accessory starter kits (high repeat propensity, 70 %+ NTB) – no additional media cost.
- **Explore Pinterest Shopping & Performance Max for Bing:** Low incremental spend could add $10 k-$15 k revenue at 3 + ROAS based on current CPC benchmarks.
- **Improve channel tracking:** Ensure GA UTM governance for AppLovin & Referral sources to reduce “Other” bucket, enabling clearer budget decisions.
