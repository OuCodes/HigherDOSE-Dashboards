- Reactivate dormant affiliates with incentive program; webinar and product education.

## Budget Guardrails (align to `q4-2025-channel-spend-plan.csv` trends)

- Google: Maintain strong ROAS baseline; scale into seasonal peaks; protect brand terms.
- TikTok: Test-and-scale approach; limit to winners via Spark.
- Affiliate: Paid boosts limited to high-quality placements; track assisted revenue.

## KPI Targets
- ROAS floors by channel: Meta ≥1.5 prospecting, ≥2.0 retargeting; Google ≥3.0 blended; TikTok ≥1.2 test phase.
- CAC vs AOV bands per product tier; payback under 45 days for accessories/consumables.
- Incrementality checks during promos (holdouts where feasible; MMM/nb insights where available).

## Launch & Promo Timeline

- July 8–11: Prime Day-adjacent offers; affiliate + paid extensions.
- Mid-July–Aug: Body Sculptor paid spend; reviews/testimonials; Hamptons/travel context.
- Late Aug: Red Light Wrap presale announcement; editor seeding; build waitlist via lead gen.
- Sept: Back to Routine; PEMF education and Red Light skin healing creatives.

## Execution Checklist
- Map best UGC to each funnel stage; brief creators on “sexy science + poetic” tone.
- Build lead-gen for Wrap presale; warm sequence; early-bird incentive testing.
- Refresh press/celeb quote ads weekly; rotate 3–5 hooks per product.
- Sync promo calendars across Meta/Google/TikTok/Affiliate; QA pricing and feeds.
- Implement video view retargeting windows (7/25/50/95%) and creator lander pixels.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Creative fatigue: Weekly hook rotation and new UGC sourcing cadence.
- Promo overlap cannibalization: Stagger offers; clear messaging hierarchy.
- Tracking gaps: Ensure channel UTMs/lead forms and affiliate attribution rules are consistent.
