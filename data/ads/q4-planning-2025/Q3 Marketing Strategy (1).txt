Body Sculptor Messaging Focus

The HigherDOSE Body Sculptor feels like deep tissue massage, lymphatic drainage, and fascia release—all in one smart tool powered by 
microcurrent and red light. It relieves tension, clears stagnation, and tones your muscles so you feel lighter, sculpted, and glowing from the 
inside out.

“Release. Sculpt. Glow.”

“Bodywork, reimagined.”

“Where fascia meets flow.”

(Sexy science and a bit poetic.)

Content Focus: The (new) Summer Body

CORE THEME: “The (new) Summer Body: Glow Starts Within
A reframe of the traditional “summer body” conversation. It’s not about crash diets or aesthetic pressure—it’s about optimizing what’s underneath the skin to look and feel your 
best. Think fascia, lymph, muscle, circulation, and energy flow.

Muscle Isn’t Just for Strength—It’s for Mood
Microcurrent and muscle stimulation: not just toning, but energy, metabolism, posture, and confidence

Why we need to activate dormant muscles (especially postural ones)

Mind-muscle connection = mind-body connection

Content Focus: Travel Focus

CORE THEME: 

The High Life, Wherever you are

Tis the season for travel! Whether road tripping or jetsetting, these tips and portable products make committing to DOSE easy, wherever you go. 

Travel Essentials for Road trips 

-
-
-

InfraredPEMF Go Mat for stiff muscles from long car rides
Stay sculpted, wherever you are with portable microcurrent body sculptor 
EMF Blocking Fanny Pack for hiking, errands and all the in-between

Jetset in Good Health

-
-
-
-

Red Light Cap easy to travel, wherever you are. Consistency is key for results so make sure to pack! 
Red Light Mask for circadian rhythm (jetlag/sleep) and skin support (dry skin on planes) 
Hydration Kit: dehydration and dry skin are notorious issues associated with flying! 
Lymphatic Drainage with copper body dry brush and microcurrent body sculptor to reduce inflammation and swelling

Problem/Solution:

●
●
●
●
●

Stiff muscles / back pain from long flights and car rides: infrared, microcurrent
Jetlag / Sleep: Magnesium, PEMF, Red Light Mask
Circadian rhythm: Red Light Mask
Swelling + Inflammation: body sculpting and dry brushing 
Dry skin + Dehydration: glow serum, red light mask, high-dration powder

Would be cool to do UGC viral challenge showing “DOSE On the Go” - maybe part of a larger sweepstakes? 

Content Focus: Glow Starts Within

CORE THEME: 

Hydration Gets You High/Glow Starts within 

Hydration Gets You High:

-

-

Highdration Powder & Water Bottle combo easy to travel with, tastes amazing, makes a great 
mocktail
Glow Serum - summer skin needs hydration more than you think

Sunbathing/Getting Natural Vitamin D - A Dip in the Sea (FOMO for corporate girlies)

-
Oxytocin Oil
- Mag Spray 
-
-

Red Light Bathing
Vitamin D responsibly (Blog post!)

Content Focus: Permission to Play - Serotonin + Dopamine Boosts

CORE THEME: 

Wellness isn’t just about strict regimes and habit stacking. The feel-good oxytocin hormone of connection comes alive when we’re supported by community! A meaningful 
conversation with a confidant, a full belly laugh with a new friend, a workout flow circuit with fellow wellness babes. There’s so many ways to get high, naturally and opt for 
sober-friendly summer activities that fit the DOSE lifestyle.

-
-
-

Permission to Play! Wellness shouldn’t be strictly serious, let’s have some fun with it
Sober friendly rituals of oxytocin and connection: hiking, barefoot walks on the beach, ecstatic dance, spa dates
