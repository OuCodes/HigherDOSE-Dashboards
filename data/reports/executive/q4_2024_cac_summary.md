## 2. What They’re Buying & How That Drives Repeat Purchases

### Products that *create* returning customers  
(Highest ratio of returning-to-new orders, **min 75 new orders**)
| Product | New Orders | Returning Orders | Repeat Ratio |
|---------|-----------:|-----------------:|-------------:|
| Replacement Cord – Sauna Blanket (Black) | 97 | 412 | **4.3×** |
| HigherDOSE Red Light Face Mask (sample) | 866 | 2,781 | 3.2× |
| Replacement Cord – Red Light Mask | 122 | 344 | 2.8× |
| High-Dration Powder | 121 | 251 | 2.1× |
| Infrared Sauna Blanket (Refurb/Comp) | 399 | 826 | 2.1× |

> **Insight:** Accessories, consumable samples and replacement parts are bought mostly by existing customers, making them efficient for email/SMS upsells rather than paid prospecting.

### Products that *attract* first-time buyers  
(Top absolute new-customer order volume)
| Product | New Orders | Returning Orders |
|---------|-----------:|-----------------:|
| HighDration Kit | **9,370** | 2,344 |
| HigherDOSE Red Light Face Mask | 9,863 | 2,081 |
| Infrared Sauna Blanket | 7,458 | 1,077 |
| Red Light Hat | 3,616 | 2,172 |
| Infrared PEMF Go Mat | 3,198 | 1,345 |

> **Insight:** High-ticket hardware (red-light devices, sauna blanket, PEMF mats) and entry-price bundles dominate new acquisition. Ensuring a tight accessory/consumable follow-up flow can lift lifetime value.

### Recommended Journey Actions
1. **Hardware → Accessory sequencing** – Trigger accessory emails/SMS 14–21 days post-delivery (e.g., replacement cords, insert liners) to capture the early repeat window.
2. **Sample → Full-size cross-sell** – Samples such as Endorphin/Oxytocin oils convert well with existing customers; include full-size upgrade offers in package inserts and Klaviyo flows.
3. **Bundle refresh before Q4** – Rituals & Kits and bundles converted the most new customers; introduce a summer bundle drop to smooth seasonality and acquire earlier in the year.
