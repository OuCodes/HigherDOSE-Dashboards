# Weekly Insights — 04 Aug 2025 → 10 Aug 2025

## Wins & Updates
• **Weekly Updates 8/08 | Sharma × HD** – L7 Sales $283.7 k (+8 % WoW, +22 % YoY) and Spend $73.5 k  
• **Meta / TikTok ads approved** on 8 & 10 Aug – new creative rotations live  
• Northbeam **weekly data exports delivered** on 4 & 11 Aug (data readiness confirmed)

## Challenges
• Team flagged a **mid-week performance slowdown** (8 Aug mail thread) – monitoring required over the weekend  
• Ongoing attribution questions around **Checkmate** pixel (multiple “Tomorrow’s Meeting” threads)

## Opportunities & Solutions
• Snap vs TikTok orchestration (8 Aug Elevar): Use TikTok for TOF creative testing; retarget high‑intent audiences on Snapchat using Elevar server‑side events (product views, repeat buyers). Measure CPA/ROAS and attribution impact.
• Amazon exited Google Shopping auctions (late Jul; highlighted 8 Aug): Short‑term upside for Shopping—review auction insights and test more aggressive bids on best‑performing SKUs for 7 days; monitor CPC and impression share.
• TikTok “Engaged Session” (8 Aug): Layer with Elevar scroll‑depth/time‑on‑page to optimize creative and landing pages based on post‑click quality, not just clicks.
• Pinterest moment tests (8 Aug): Map “moments” (seasonal/emotional triggers), pass custom events via Elevar to segment by theme, and A/B test hooks to find highest‑intent segments.

• Audit Meta “Website Optimization” toggles; enforce UTMs via Elevar to prevent destination URL overrides impacting attribution. Source: 8 Aug Elevar.
• Migrate Shopify Order Status scripts to Checkout Extensibility before Aug 28; QA page_view, add_to_cart, begin_checkout, purchase. Source: 8 Aug Elevar.

## Website & CRO
• PDP copy upgrades (8 Aug TikTok): Implement concise, benefit‑led product descriptions for Sauna Blanket, Red Light Hat; prioritize scannability and clarity.
• Add shoppable links (8 Aug TikTok): Ensure PDPs and key content surfaces include shoppable links to reduce friction, including TikTok Shop placements where applicable.
• Enforce landing‑page/UTM integrity (8 Aug Elevar): If Meta “Website Optimization” is on, lock UTMs and canonical PDPs via Elevar parameter mapping to avoid unintended LP swaps.
• Checkout Extensibility (due Aug 28): Move any Order Status Additional Scripts to Checkout Extensibility; validate all ecommerce events in GA4/Meta/Snap/TikTok after migration.
• Google & YouTube app tagging: Confirm Google tag migration to Shopify’s official app to avoid August checkout flow issues; re‑QA purchase attribution end‑to‑end.

## Notes on Creative Testing Constraints
• None explicitly raised this week, but note Meta can now **override destination URLs** (Elevar newsletter) – ensure UTMs enforced

1. Monitor weekend performance (Sharma × HD) and flag anomalies Monday.  
2. Confirm Checkmate attribution setup in Shopify; report back to Chris & Ingrid.  
3. Short-list Snap creative tests based on Elevar’s playbook and allocate <$5 k pilot budget.  
4. Update website PDP copy using TikTok description best-practice guide.  
5. Ensure Meta landing-page URL overrides are disabled or UTMs locked.
