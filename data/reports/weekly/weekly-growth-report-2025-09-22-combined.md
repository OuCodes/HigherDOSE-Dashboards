## 3. Wins & Updates
- **WoW performance improved**: Revenue $221,083 (+18%), ROAS 2.49 (+32%), ROAS 1st 2.13 (+45%), while spend decreased to $88,808 (-11%).
- **Channels with positive momentum**: Awin ROAS 2.73 (+23% WoW); ShopMyShelf ROAS 1.78 (+25% WoW); Microsoft Ads ROAS 2.29 (+639% WoW).
- **TikTok campaign standout**: Spark Ads testing delivered ROAS 19.83 on low spend.
- **API enablement**: Google Ads API developer token approved (Basic Access); internal reporting tool permitted.
- **Ops**: Northbeam weekly export available for automated processing.

## 4. Challenges
- **Efficiency headwinds**: Transactions down 16% WoW; blended CAC rose to $188 (+6%).
- **Google Ads efficiency**: ROAS 0.73 (improved but below target); heavy spend on Demand Gen with ROAS 0.05 indicates waste.
- **Meta efficiency**: Facebook Ads ROAS 0.29 with CAC > $1,500; minimal attributed conversions.
- **Attribution coverage**: Concentrated unattributed revenue; review alias mapping for brand/PMax and affiliates.

## 5. Opportunities & Solutions
- Reallocate budget from underperforming Demand Gen to Search/PMax Brand and high-ROAS campaigns.
- Expand partners that worked: Scale Awin and ShopMyShelf creators with incremental tests and SKU targeting.
- TikTok growth: Build on Spark Ads winning format; consider Short Video Challenge for incremental GMV and credit.
- API automation: Use Google Ads API access to automate account-level and campaign reporting; enable email-only notifications for monitoring.
- Attribution hygiene: Triage top unattributed spend lines; add/refine aliases for brand terms, affiliates, and creators.

## 6. Task List & Priorities (Jourdan)
1. Accept Google Ads email-only notifications invite for `458-964-9684`.
2. Add Google Ads API credentials/tokens in `config/google_ads/` and wire to `scripts/google_ads_export.py` for weekly pulls.
3. Audit and pause/limit `[SB] - Evergreen - Demand Gen` until creative/targeting fix; reallocate to winning brand Search/PMax.
4. Create an alias review doc from "Top Unattributed Spend" and propose mappings for brand/affiliate/creator entries.
5. Queue TikTok Spark Ads creative variants; evaluate eligibility for Short Video Challenge credit.
6. Pull Northbeam weekly export and refresh dashboards used in the weekly report.

## 7. Notes on Creative Testing Constraints
- No new constraints observed in the last 7 days. Continue monitoring `sb-higherdose-creative` for updates.

## 8. Next Steps / Action Items
1. Implement Google Ads API reporting and schedule weekly exports; document quotas and fallback.
2. Budget shift: reduce Demand Gen; increase Brand Search/PMax where ROAS ≥ 1.2 and CAC trending down.
3. Affiliate/creator plan: expand high-ROAS Awin partners and ShopMyShelf creators; add 2–3 net-new tests.
4. Attribution: resolve top 20 unattributed spend items; reprocess and compare lift in attributed ROAS.
5. TikTok: produce and launch 3–5 Spark Ads variants; consider enrollment in Short Video Challenge.
