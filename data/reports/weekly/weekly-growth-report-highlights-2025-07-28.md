# Weekly Growth Report Highlights  
*Reporting window: **21 Jul – 27 Jul 2025***

## Wins & Updates (Brand-wide)
- **23 Jul** – Google P-Max scaling test: top-revenue products remained efficient on ROAS; budgets stay elevated.
- **21–24 Jul** – New Meta creative batches (core products) launched and gathering weekend data.
- **21 Jul** – Team alignment: positive momentum noted following budget push.

## Challenges
- GA4 migration incomplete; Shopify checkout update could break current tags (need Cardinal ↔ Annatta hand-off).
- TROAS adjustment dilemma: improving ROAS would cut spend during revenue push.
- Sauna Blanket & PEMF Mat sales lag YoY; require fresh creative.

## Opportunities & Solutions
- Proposed daily Klaviyo campaign cadence to accelerate list-growth and revenue.
- Schedule Bark / Prescient call to calibrate CAC-by-product KPIs.
- Maintain aggressive Google budgets while performance trend is favourable.

- Secure Cardinal POC and verify SMS list migration status.
- Book KPI alignment call; prep agenda.
