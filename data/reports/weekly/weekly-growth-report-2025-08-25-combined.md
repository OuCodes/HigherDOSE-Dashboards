## 4. Wins & Updates  
- CRM: Loyalty Lion + Wonderment flows approved, fixes shipped; flow previews and tracker maintained throughout the week (8/19–8/22)
- Search: Bing/Google performance improved after recent optimizations; plan aligned to scale Demand Gen for 4 weeks starting next Monday (8/19–8/21)
- Email ops: AB tests queued; daily sends scheduled and QA’d quickly with iterative fixes (8/18–8/21)
- Content: Blog brief drafted and circulated for “Red Light vs. Infrared Therapy” (8/20)

## 5. Challenges  
- Data cleanliness: Large round of “Agency 8” discounted orders still polluting NB unless fully excluded (8/18)
- Tracking/view variance: Prescient vs NB methodology requires clear context-sharing to stakeholders (8/20)
- Security: Sophisticated phishing attempts targeting team inboxes (8/18)
- Inventory: Only ~20 RL Mats available; messaging needs to manage scarcity (8/21)

## 6. Opportunities & Solutions  
- Rebalance paid mix pre‑LDW: Shift some budget earlier from LDW spike to maintain steady revenue pacing; align Paid Social vs Search pacing (8/18–8/19)
- TT channel focus: Favor Bodycare/MBS where traction shows up in MTA; evaluate catalog/video shopping ads (requires Business Center access) (8/19)
- Simplify feeds: Explore reducing reliance on Feedonomics with Google guidance while preserving historical mapping (8/19–8/22)
- CRM iteration: Remove legacy tags (e.g., longplay), standardize dynamic links, keep AB cadence (8/21–8/22)

## 7. Task List & Priorities  
- Approve Demand Gen scale plan and monitor first‑week pacing vs goals (from 8/21 alignment)
- Ensure Business Center admin access for Sharma (Jeremy/Berkeley) to enable TT catalog/video shopping ads
- Confirm NB exclusion rules for Agency 8 orders; validate reporting post‑exclusion
- Coordinate LDW email/product mix with inventory constraints (stack PEMF + RL Mat + Oxytocin Oil angle)
- Review PDP fixes: date correction (2024→2025), “IN PRODUCTION” messaging, and shipping ETA language
- Keep CRM tracker current and ensure final QA on Loyalty Lion/Wonderment previews

## 8. Notes on Creative Testing Constraints  
- RL Mat inventory limited (~20 units): avoid over‑weighting RL‑only messages in email/ads; use stack/evergreen angles (8/21)

## 9. Next Steps / Action Items (Week of Aug 25)  
1. Align Paid budgets: enable Demand Gen scaling test; monitor daily learnings and redistribute if needed (start next Monday)
2. TT enablement: grant Business Center admin to Sharma; stand up product catalog with video shopping ads
3. Data hygiene: finalize NB exclusion for Agency 8 orders; document impact vs prior weeks
4. LDW comms: ship staff picks and add‑on “double your dose” variants; ensure 20%/25% offer logic is accurate
5. PDP fixes: update RL Mat date and status; confirm copy reflects late‑October shipping ETA
6. CRM housekeeping: remove legacy “longplay” tags; validate dynamic links and flow triggers post‑edits
7. Blog: finalize copy, embed product education, and schedule with cross‑channel support
