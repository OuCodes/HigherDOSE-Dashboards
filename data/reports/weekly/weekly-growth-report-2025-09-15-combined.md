## 3. Wins & Updates
- MTD revenue pacing **+7 pp ahead** of goal ($987 k vs $2.094 M target).  
- Meta CAC **-26 %** L7D after scale-down and fresh UGC.  
- Google campaign clean-up (negatives, sitelinks, tROAS) improving efficiency.  
- **Postscript popup test** approved by Ingrid; rollout this week.

## 4. Challenges
- Post-sale revenue dip since 9/4; need ~$61.5 k/day to hit MTD goal.  
- TikTok ROAS ~1.0; attribution accuracy under review.  
- Ingrid concerned that **49 % of Google spend is branded**, potentially cannibalising organic.

## 5. Opportunities & Solutions
- Shift budget toward non-brand Google campaigns to address cannibalisation.  
- Leverage new UGC on Meta to sustain lower CAC.  
- Use upcoming Postscript popup to capture incremental emails.

## 6. Task List & Priorities (Jourdan)
1. Track spend pacing vs $380 k budget; flag overspend risk.  
2. Coordinate TikTok × Northbeam attribution fix.  
3. Provide GA4 service-account access (requested by Chris).  
4. Share royalty-free music software name with Chris.  
5. Extend LDW summary (include extra 2 days) per Ingrid.  
6. Monitor usage-rights calendar for Jenee Calabrese & Dallas Combs assets.

## 7. Notes on Creative Testing Constraints
- Jenee Calabrese: renewed 30-day usage.  
- Michael Lynn: WL-only usage; approval needed for CTV.  
- Dallas Combs usage expired 9/09; renewal in progress.

## 8. Next Steps / Action Items
1. Acquire updated rights for Michael Lynn & Dallas Combs UGC.  
2. Continue TikTok attribution debug; follow-up with NB team.  
3. Keep Google spend within reduced budget while monitoring ROAS.  
4. Prepare Q4 webinar (Sept 17).  
5. Evaluate non-brand Google budget shift.
