## Weekly Growth Report Highlights — 2025-09-15

### Wins & Updates
- MTD revenue at **$987K** vs $2.094 M goal; pacing **+7 pp** ahead. (Email: `data/mail/exports/20250912-end-of-week-updates-912-sharma-x-hd-1993f7a3860fb432.md`)
- Meta CAC **-26 % L7D** after scale-down and fresh UGC. (Same source)

### Challenges
- Post-sale revenue dip 9/4-present; need ~$61.5 K/day to hit target. (Email above)
- TikTok ROAS still ~1.0; attribution accuracy under review. (`data/mail/exports/20250912-end-of-week-updates-912-sharma-x-hd-1993f7a3860fb432.md`)
- Ingrid expressed concern that **49 % of Google Search spend is on branded terms**; possible cannibalization of organic traffic. (`data/slack/exports/dm_with_Ingrid_4YDWBF.md` lines 3029-3038)

### Opportunities & Solutions

- Identify “pockets of efficiency” in scaled-down Google campaigns—monitor PMax after tROAS activation.
- Assess shifting budget from branded to non-brand Google campaigns to address Ingrid’s concern.
- Leverage upcoming Postscript popup to capture more first-party emails.
