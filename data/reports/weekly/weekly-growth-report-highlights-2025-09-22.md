## Wins & Updates

- **WoW performance improved**: Revenue $221,083 (+18%), ROAS 2.49 (+32%), ROAS 1st 2.13 (+45%), while spend decreased to $88,808 (-11%). [SR1]
- **Channels with positive momentum**: Awin ROAS 2.73 (+23% WoW); ShopMyShelf ROAS 1.78 (+25% WoW); Microsoft Ads ROAS 2.29 (+639% WoW). [SR1]
- **TikTok campaign standout**: Spark Ads testing delivered ROAS 19.83 on low spend. [SR1]
- **API enablement**: Google Ads API developer token approved (Basic Access); internal reporting tool permitted. [SR2][SR3]
- **Ops**: Northbeam weekly export available for automated processing. [SR6]

## Challenges

- **Efficiency headwinds**: Transactions down 16% WoW; blended CAC rose to $188 (+6%). [SR1]
- **Google Ads efficiency**: ROAS 0.73 (improved but still below target); heavy spend on Demand Gen with ROAS 0.05 indicates waste. [SR1]
- **Meta efficiency**: Facebook Ads ROAS 0.29 with CAC > $1,500; minimal attributed conversions. [SR1]
- **Attribution coverage**: Concentrated unattributed revenue; review alias mapping for brand/PMax and affiliates. [SR1]

## Opportunities & Solutions

- **Reallocate budget from underperforming Demand Gen to Search/PMax Brand and high-ROAS campaigns.** [SR1]
- **Expand partners that worked**: Scale Awin and ShopMyShelf creators with incremental tests and SKU targeting. [SR1]
- **TikTok growth**: Build on Spark Ads winning format; consider Short Video Challenge for incremental GMV and credit. [SR1][SR5]
- **API automation**: Use new Google Ads API access to automate account-level and campaign reporting; enable email-only notifications for monitoring. [SR2][SR4]
- **Attribution hygiene**: Triage top unattributed spend lines; add/refine aliases for brand terms, affiliates, and creators. [SR1]

## Daily Task List & Priorities (Jourdan)

- Accept Google Ads email-only notifications invite for `458-964-9684`. [SR4]
- Add Google Ads API credentials/tokens in `config/google_ads/` and wire to `scripts/google_ads_export.py` for weekly pulls. [SR2]
- Audit and pause/limit `[SB] - Evergreen - Demand Gen` until creative/targeting fix; reallocate to winning brand Search/PMax. [SR1]
- Create an alias review doc from "Top Unattributed Spend" and propose mappings for brand/affiliate/creator entries. [SR1]
- Queue TikTok Spark Ads creative variants; evaluate eligibility for Short Video Challenge credit. [SR1][SR5]
- Pull Northbeam weekly export and refresh dashboards used in the weekly report. [SR6]

## Affiliate Insights

- Awin: Spend $7,897 → Revenue $21,564, ROAS 2.73 (+23% WoW). Opportunity to scale select partners driving incremental revenue. [SR1]
- ShopMyShelf: Spend $4,136 → Revenue $7,365, ROAS 1.78; strong WoW growth across multiple creators. [SR1]

## Motion & Creative Reporting Insights

- TikTok Spark Ads concept is resonating; replicate winning elements into additional cuts and lengths. [SR1]
- Meta creative-fatigue likely (low ROAS); prioritize new hooks/offers for Body Care and core devices to improve efficiency. [SR1]

## Website & CRO

- High AOV products (PEMF Pro, Sauna Blanket) continue to contribute materially; ensure PDPs emphasize financing, trust, and comparison content to support high-consideration purchases. [SR1]

## Notes on Creative Testing Constraints

- No new constraints observed in the last 7 days. Continue monitoring `sb-higherdose-creative` for updates.

## Next Steps / Action Items

- Implement Google Ads API reporting and schedule weekly exports; document quotas and fallback. [SR2][SR3]
- Budget shift: reduce Demand Gen; increase Brand Search/PMax where ROAS ≥ 1.2 and CAC trending down. [SR1]
- Affiliate/creator plan: expand high-ROAS Awin partners and ShopMyShelf creators; add 2–3 net-new tests. [SR1]
- Attribution: resolve top 20 unattributed spend items; reprocess and compare lift in attributed ROAS. [SR1]
- TikTok: produce and launch 3–5 Spark Ads variants; consider enrollment in Short Video Challenge. [SR1][SR5]
