- **2025-07-14 16:19** *Laura*: I also have a creative deck started as well - are these all brand led vs product?
- **2025-07-14 16:20** *Laura*: i think we have enough from past shoots + capetown that we don't need another shoot for this
- **2025-07-14 16:22** *Anastasia*: agreed - we have some really great content to test this with. We just need to confirm Cape Town usage - i'll check with Jess and Lauren.
- **2025-07-14 16:22** *Laura*: i think we own what we have, no?
- **2025-07-14 16:23** *Jourdan*: Yeah I agree we should be able to work with existing content. The vendors I’ve spoken with say evergreen content works best and I think it would be ideal to start with product led to see which are most effective on the channel. In general the vendors recommended A/B testing and starting with 4 videos but TvScientific may have slightly different opinions
- **2025-07-14 16:24** *Laura*: ok, i thought @Ingrid you did want this to be more brand vs lower funnel/product, but i guess if we can test four we can do some of each?
