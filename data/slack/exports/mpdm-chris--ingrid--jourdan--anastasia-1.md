- **2025-07-14 17:38** *Chris Jacob*: @Anastasia how do these codes work "ShopMy Lookbook Discount"
- **2025-07-15 06:54** *Anastasia*: Are these showing up on Shopify next to a product order amount totaling $0 ? 
- **2025-07-15 06:55** *Chris Jacob*: Yes
- **2025-07-15 06:55** *Anastasia*: If yes then that is agency eight gifting via ShopMY 
- **2025-07-15 07:00** *Chris Jacob*: apologies if this was my misunderstanding from that call but this can't function that way
- **2025-07-15 07:01** *Chris Jacob*: they're using regular skus and a 100% discount code instead of $0 skus
- **2025-07-15 07:01** *Anastasia*: They should be using the free SKU’s 
- **2025-07-15 07:02** *Anastasia*: We gave them the SKU’s with the C at the end - is that still incorrect?
- **2025-07-15 07:02** *Chris Jacob*: can you have them immediately pause additional ordering while we sort
- **2025-07-15 07:02** *Chris Jacob*: no thats correct but then they wouldnt need a discount code
- **2025-07-15 07:02** *Anastasia*: Yes will do! Can you please share the correct SKU names with me and I’ll get that adjusted asap
- **2025-07-15 07:03** *Anastasia*: We haven’t given them a discount code - may be because it’s going through ShopMY.
- **2025-07-15 07:05** *Chris Jacob*: yes i see it coming in as a code but not in the normal course so somewhere in the chain its generating something that allows this
- **2025-07-15 07:06** *Chris Jacob*: i thought they were going to input orders (like our cs agents do) but this implies maybe the individual creators are placing their own choice of order through some system or something
- **2025-07-15 07:06** *Chris Jacob*: easiest to just get on call with them probably figure out together
- **2025-07-15 07:12** *Chris Jacob*: they asked for 200 gifts and have sent 179 so if the remaining 21 are alredy in process lets proceed as is i dont want creators to hit some tech roadblock
- **2025-07-15 07:12** *Chris Jacob*: can fix for go forward
- **2025-07-15 07:35** *Anastasia*: Ok, I let them know to hold. It will be a ShopMY thing - need to work with them directly. 
- **2025-07-15 07:36** *Anastasia*: Will get it sorted out today.

- **2025-07-15 12:35** *Anastasia*: I have asked them to stop and I have reached out to SHopMY - the issue is that they have already sent over gifting requests to creators and they are going in and accepting them. Trying to swap over SKu's - waiting on ShopMY to get back to me.
- **2025-07-15 12:38** *Chris Jacob*: if there's a reasonably limited # of those remaining (between these two groups they're near or beyond 200) it's not worth frustrating creators themselves we'll just deal with it on back end

- **2025-07-21 18:16** *Chris Jacob*: What do they do
- **2025-07-21 18:17** *Jourdan*: It’s tracking for the CTV partner
- **2025-07-21 18:17** *Jourdan*: tracking purchases
- **2025-07-21 18:17** *Chris Jacob*: Is there a contract
- **2025-07-21 18:20** *Jourdan*: Just included you on main email thread asking Erika (Onboarding Specialist) to connect you with anyone that can answer tech questions
- **2025-07-21 18:20** *Jourdan*: so between her &amp; whoever she responds with
- **2025-07-21 18:20** *Jourdan*: but the way i see it, it’s like meta’s base pixel code that tracks pageview on every step and a purchase event
- **2025-07-21 18:23** *Jourdan*: Ahh you said contract and not contact. My apologies sir! They’d be running CTV as an affiliate for us. I believe 10% commissions and $15k budget to start but @Anastasia may be able to assist on more details
- **2025-07-21 18:25** *Chris Jacob*: @Anastasia I see that Lauren signed a document I had not seen attached

- **2025-07-23 07:10** *Anastasia*: @Chris Jacob just resent and changed the subject line to TvScientific 
- **2025-07-23 07:10** *Anastasia*: With all documents that they shared with us.
- **2025-07-23 09:06** *Chris Jacob*: I can speak to their business people but initial items are  
• Document references "Affiliate network IO/program terms" we need a copy  
• Please explain clause G  
• How do returns work?  
• There are no economic terms in this document (e.g. % commissions)  
• Confirm the missing clause h.f. should not exist and is a typo  
• If not provided in the document needed above we need NDA/data protection clauses  
• Confirm we will have access to a real time portal to assess accrued attributions (otherwise they could show up at the end of the month and say we owe some large amount)

- **2025-07-15 07:06** *Chris Jacob*: easiest to just get on call with them probably figure out together
- **2025-07-15 07:12** *Chris Jacob*: they asked for 200 gifts and have sent 179 so if the remaining 21 are alredy in process lets proceed as is i dont want creators to hit some tech roadblock

- **2025-07-15 12:38** *Chris Jacob*: if there's a reasonably limited # of those remaining (between these two groups they're near or beyond 200) it's not worth frustrating creators themselves we'll just deal with it on back end

- **2025-07-14 17:38** *Chris Jacob*: @Anastasia how do these codes work "ShopMy Lookbook Discount"
- **2025-07-15 06:54** *Anastasia*: Are these showing up on Shopify next to a product order amount totaling $0 ? 
- **2025-07-15 06:55** *Chris Jacob*: Yes
- **2025-07-15 06:55** *Anastasia*: If yes then that is agency eight gifting via ShopMY 
- **2025-07-15 07:00** *Chris Jacob*: apologies if this was my misunderstanding from that call but this can't function that way
- **2025-07-15 07:01** *Chris Jacob*: they're using regular skus and a 100% discount code instead of $0 skus
- **2025-07-15 07:01** *Anastasia*: They should be using the free SKU’s 
- **2025-07-15 07:02** *Anastasia*: We gave them the SKU’s with the C at the end - is that still incorrect?
- **2025-07-15 07:02** *Chris Jacob*: can you have them immediately pause additional ordering while we sort
- **2025-07-15 07:02** *Chris Jacob*: no thats correct but then they wouldnt need a discount code
- **2025-07-15 07:02** *Anastasia*: Yes will do! Can you please share the correct SKU names with me and I’ll get that adjusted asap
- **2025-07-15 07:03** *Anastasia*: We haven’t given them a discount code - may be because it’s going through ShopMY.
- **2025-07-15 07:05** *Chris Jacob*: yes i see it coming in as a code but not in the normal course so somewhere in the chain its generating something that allows this
- **2025-07-15 07:06** *Chris Jacob*: i thought they were going to input orders (like our cs agents do) but this implies maybe the individual creators are placing their own choice of order through some system or something
- **2025-07-15 07:06** *Chris Jacob*: easiest to just get on call with them probably figure out together
- **2025-07-15 07:12** *Chris Jacob*: they asked for 200 gifts and have sent 179 so if the remaining 21 are alredy in process lets proceed as is i dont want creators to hit some tech roadblock
- **2025-07-15 07:12** *Chris Jacob*: can fix for go forward
- **2025-07-15 07:35** *Anastasia*: Ok, I let them know to hold. It will be a ShopMY thing - need to work with them directly. 
- **2025-07-15 07:36** *Anastasia*: Will get it sorted out today.
- **2025-07-15 12:34** *Chris Jacob* 💬 1 reply: @Anastasia ok you can go back to telling them to outright stop they're doing this also creating their own $0 orders
- **2025-07-15 12:34** *Chris Jacob* 💬 2 replies: 📎 **image.png** (png, 203.4KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F095XGCGKH8/image.png)
- **2025-07-15 12:35** *Anastasia*: I have asked them to stop and I have reached out to SHopMY - the issue is that they have already sent over gifting requests to creators and they are going in and accepting them. Trying to swap over SKu's - waiting on ShopMY to get back to me.
- **2025-07-15 12:38** *Chris Jacob*: if there's a reasonably limited # of those remaining (between these two groups they're near or beyond 200) it's not worth frustrating creators themselves we'll just deal with it on back end
- **2025-07-21 18:14** *Anastasia* 💬 1 reply: TVscientific is asking us to install a pixel to Shopify for tracking. @Chris Jacob is this something I share with Michael to do?

- **2025-07-21 18:16** *Chris Jacob*: What do they do
- **2025-07-21 18:17** *Jourdan*: It’s tracking for the CTV partner
- **2025-07-21 18:17** *Jourdan*: tracking purchases
- **2025-07-21 18:17** *Chris Jacob*: Is there a contract
- **2025-07-21 18:20** *Jourdan*: Just included you on main email thread asking Erika (Onboarding Specialist) to connect you with anyone that can answer tech questions
- **2025-07-21 18:20** *Jourdan*: so between her &amp; whoever she responds with
- **2025-07-21 18:20** *Jourdan*: but the way i see it, it’s like meta’s base pixel code that tracks pageview on every step and a purchase event
- **2025-07-21 18:23** *Jourdan*: Ahh you said contract and not contact. My apologies sir! They’d be running CTV as an affiliate for us. I believe 10% commissions and $15k budget to start but @Anastasia may be able to assist on more details
- **2025-07-21 18:25** *Chris Jacob*: @Anastasia I see that Lauren signed a document I had not seen attached
- **2025-07-21 18:25** *Chris Jacob*: This is not a valid contract nor confidentiality provisions were there other thigns?

- **2025-07-22 16:39** *Chris Jacob*: @Anastasia let me know background on this so we can get an appropriate doc? was there something else besides this?
- **2025-07-23 03:16** *Anastasia*: @Chris Jacob sent an email with more details,  Ctv is new to me, learning as we go. Let me know what concerns and questions come up and ill make sure to get answers. \n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Jourdan*
- **2025-07-23 07:07** *Chris Jacob*: Didn't get email send again please? But were there other documents?
- **2025-07-23 07:10** *Anastasia*: @Chris Jacob just resent and changed the subject line to TvScientific 
- **2025-07-23 07:10** *Anastasia*: With all documents that they shared with us.
- **2025-07-23 09:06** *Chris Jacob*: I can speak to their business people but initial items are  
• Document references "Affiliate network IO/program terms" we need a copy  
• Please explain clause G  
• How do returns work?  
• There are no economic terms in this document (e.g. % commissions)  
• Confirm the missing clause h.f. should not exist and is a typo  
• If not provided in the document needed above we need NDA/data protection clauses  
• Confirm we will have access to a real time portal to assess accrued attributions (otherwise they could show up at the end of the month and say we owe some large amount)
- **2025-07-28 09:35** *Anastasia*: • Tracking:  
• Integration Guides for Pixel &amp; Postback (attached)  
• We now have the [Shopify Plug-in](https://help.tvscientific.app/en/articles/9150998-install-the-tvscientific-shopify-app)!  
• We have Affiliate Network Master/Universal Tags with Awin

- **2025-07-28 13:34** *Anastasia*: <!channel> From Kylie: TVScientific - very little double attribution from a competitor brand.  
Kylie said she hasn’t heard any negative or partnership issues.
- **2025-07-30 11:56** *Chris Jacob*: @Anastasia as it regards the response we just got, if we were to agree to their terms, are you aware if Awin has an ability to modify terms for a single affiliate? That is what would have to happen to pay them on time, somehow ignore returns, etc
