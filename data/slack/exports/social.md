• **Juneteenth 6/19**: we have Juneteenth coming up on the 19th, we had mentioned doing a donation for that. How about running from Monday the 14th to Saturday the 19th we do 5% to Black Women for Wellness again? @User*C9D6PQ lets get some stories up for that week highlighting the work they're doing, etc  
• **International Yoga Day 6/21**: @User*C9D6PQ are we all confirmed up with Lindsey to do the evening wind down? Let's double check on that and make sure we have everything lined up today, I want to get the info back to the email team by tomorrow so we can include it in an email  
• **World Music Day 6/21**: @Katie is Bou all good to go there? Should I connect with her directly to get the files/playlist?  
• **Pride Month - June**: @User*C9D6PQ and I thought highlighting LGBTQIA+ creators similarly to what we've done with Black History Month, Women's History Month - crowd sourcing from our community, polling them on who inspires them, etc and getting a story up on that as well as paying tribute to the folks who've paved the way. Aubrey is compiling this list and getting it up on stories throughout the month.   
    ◦ @Katie is B making a playlist for this as well? If so @User*C9D6PQ lets share that throughout the month too.   
    ◦ @Katie @Lauren how about 5% donation to [the Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/) from 6/21 - 6/26?\n\n**The Trevor Project**\n🔗 **[The Trevor Project — Saving Young LGBTQ Lives](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/)**\n> A national 24-hour, toll free confidential suicide hotline for LGBTQ youth.

Nothing has changed and we haven’t been reported for anything. Only thing I can think of is sometimes when we run paid ads the platform reduces organic visibility. Curious if that’s the case
- **2022-04-20 12:20** *User_8ASVCJ*: Nothing has changed in the last few days on ads, we've been at 1k daily ad spend for a while

- **2023-08-10 15:34** *Elyse*: <!channel> hi all chiming in from OOO - want to be super clear on this. We should not be telling people they can use the sauna blankets and PEMF mat at the same time stacked on top of each other. This has not been tested for safety, and considering the blanket can melt on its own it should not be combined with another heated product. We are dealing with an influencer or affiliate or someone telling people they can do so and trying to clarify on customer service end. \n\n*Reactions: :+1: User_8ASVCJ*

- **2025-06-12 14:01** *Elyse*: @Anastasia @María José Castro for your context  
• we have facebook and instagram comments integrated with our customer service platform Kustomer  
• Facebook comments and DMs flow directly into our CS box  
• Instagram doesn’t integrate as cleanly, so we typically check these on the meta business suite  
• Social is monitored daily with special attention to any customer questions or order-related comments and general engagement secondary.

How about running from Monday the 14th to Saturday the 19th we do 5% to Black Women for Wellness again? @User*C9D6PQ lets get some stories up for that week highlighting the work they're doing, etc  
• **International Yoga Day 6/21**: @User*C9D6PQ are we all confirmed up with Lindsey to do the evening wind down? Let's double check on that and make sure we have everything lined up today, I want to get the info back to the email team by tomorrow so we can include it in an email  
• **World Music Day 6/21**: @Katie is Bou all good to go there? Should I connect with her directly to get the files/playlist?  
• **Pride Month - June**: @User*C9D6PQ and I thought highlighting LGBTQIA+ creators similarly to what we've done with Black History Month, Women's History Month - crowd sourcing from our community, polling them on who inspires them, etc and getting a story up on that as well as paying tribute to the folks who've paved the way. Aubrey is compiling this list and getting it up on stories throughout the month.   
    ◦ @Katie is B making a playlist for this as well? If so @User*C9D6PQ lets share that throughout the month too.   
    ◦ @Katie @Lauren how about 5% donation to [the Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/) from 6/21 - 6/26?\n\n**The Trevor Project**\n🔗 **[The Trevor Project — Saving Young LGBTQ Lives](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/)**\n> A national 24-hour, toll free confidential suicide hotline for LGBTQ youth.

We should not be telling people they can use the sauna blankets and PEMF mat at the same time stacked on top of each other. This has not been tested for safety, and considering the blanket can melt on its own it should not be combined with another heated product. We are dealing with an influencer or affiliate or someone telling people they can do so and trying to clarify on customer service end. \n\n*Reactions: :+1: User_8ASVCJ*

[https://www.instagram.com/p/DKufaHmRhzG/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/p/DKufaHmRhzG/?hl=en) it's good for our engagement, and also to answer questions that potential customers have.
- **2025-06-12 12:18** *Thila*: Hey @Anastasia - just a heads up that we’re not seeing these comments in Kustomer. We’ll keep the convo in MBS for now, and I’ll get our CS-social team to assist with this
- **2025-06-12 14:01** *Elyse*: @Anastasia @María José Castro for your context  
• we have facebook and instagram comments integrated with our customer service platform Kustomer  
• Facebook comments and DMs flow directly into our CS box  
• Instagram doesn’t integrate as cleanly, so we typically check these on the meta business suite  
• Social is monitored daily with special attention to any customer questions or order-related comments and general engagement secondary.
- **2025-06-12 14:01** *Elyse*: It seems like we stopped receiving Instagram comments through Kustomer around late April so we’ve been trying to get it reconnected.\n\n*Reactions: :+1::skin-tone-3: Thila*
- **2025-06-12 14:02** *Elyse*: In the meantime, the agents are working directly through the Meta business suite to answer comments and DMs\n\n*Reactions: :+1::skin-tone-3: Thila*
- **2025-06-12 14:02** *Elyse*: @María José Castro @Fiona Hillery you can skip answering the general engagement ones and let us tackle those, to avoid any duplicate responses\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Thila*

• **Juneteenth 6/19**: we have Juneteenth coming up on the 19th, we had mentioned doing a donation for that. How about running from Monday the 14th to Saturday the 19th we do 5% to Black Women for Wellness again? @User*C9D6PQ lets get some stories up for that week highlighting the work they're doing, etc  
• **International Yoga Day 6/21**: @User*C9D6PQ are we all confirmed up with Lindsey to do the evening wind down? Let's double check on that and make sure we have everything lined up today, I want to get the info back to the email team by tomorrow so we can include it in an email  
• **World Music Day 6/21**: @Katie is Bou all good to go there? Should I connect with her directly to get the files/playlist?  
• **Pride Month - June**: @User*C9D6PQ and I thought highlighting LGBTQIA+ creators similarly to what we've done with Black History Month, Women's History Month - crowd sourcing from our community, polling them on who inspires them, etc and getting a story up on that as well as paying tribute to the folks who've paved the way. Aubrey is compiling this list and getting it up on stories throughout the month.   
    ◦ @Katie is B making a playlist for this as well? If so @User*C9D6PQ lets share that throughout the month too.   
    ◦ @Katie @Lauren how about 5% donation to [the Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/) from 6/21 - 6/26?\n\n**The Trevor Project**\n🔗 **[The Trevor Project — Saving Young LGBTQ Lives](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/)**\n> A national 24-hour, toll free confidential suicide hotline for LGBTQ youth.

Nothing has changed and we haven’t been reported for anything. Only thing I can think of is sometimes when we run paid ads the platform reduces organic visibility. Curious if that’s the case
- **2022-04-20 12:20** *User_8ASVCJ*: Nothing has changed in the last few days on ads, we've been at 1k daily ad spend for a while

- **2023-08-10 15:34** *Elyse*: <!channel> hi all chiming in from OOO - want to be super clear on this. We should not be telling people they can use the sauna blankets and PEMF mat at the same time stacked on top of each other. This has not been tested for safety, and considering the blanket can melt on its own it should not be combined with another heated product. We are dealing with an influencer or affiliate or someone telling people they can do so and trying to clarify on customer service end. \n\n*Reactions: :+1: User_8ASVCJ*

- **2025-06-12 14:01** *Elyse*: @Anastasia @María José Castro for your context  
• we have facebook and instagram comments integrated with our customer service platform Kustomer

• Social is monitored daily with special attention to any customer questions or order-related comments and general engagement secondary.

• **Juneteenth 6/19**: we have Juneteenth coming up on the 19th, we had mentioned doing a donation for that. How about running from Monday the 14th to Saturday the 19th we do 5% to Black Women for Wellness again? @User*C9D6PQ lets get some stories up for that week highlighting the work they're doing, etc  
• **International Yoga Day 6/21**: @User*C9D6PQ are we all confirmed up with Lindsey to do the evening wind down? Let's double check on that and make sure we have everything lined up today, I want to get the info back to the email team by tomorrow so we can include it in an email  
• **World Music Day 6/21**: @Katie is Bou all good to go there? Should I connect with her directly to get the files/playlist?  
• **Pride Month - June**: @User*C9D6PQ and I thought highlighting LGBTQIA+ creators similarly to what we've done with Black History Month, Women's History Month - crowd sourcing from our community, polling them on who inspires them, etc and getting a story up on that as well as paying tribute to the folks who've paved the way. Aubrey is compiling this list and getting it up on stories throughout the month.   
    ◦ @Katie is B making a playlist for this as well? If so @User*C9D6PQ lets share that throughout the month too.   
    ◦ @Katie @Lauren how about 5% donation to [the Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/) from 6/21 - 6/26?\n\n**The Trevor Project**\n🔗 **[The Trevor Project — Saving Young LGBTQ Lives](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/)**\n> A national 24-hour, toll free confidential suicide hotline for LGBTQ youth.

A quick update on my end- I secured the Tik Tok accounts @higher.dose and @biohackhers and the Instagram account @biohackhers. I assume we already have the tik tok @higherdose @User_8ASVCJ?
- **2022-02-21 16:05** *Fiona Hillery*: Also @Katie our next o-shot episode is promoted on wednesday 2/23. Let us know if we'll need to hold on that promo for higher level investor convos to shake out

- **2022-04-20 09:46** *Fiona Hillery*: @User_8ASVCJ are we running any Insta ads? Our organic engagement has taken a big dip and we were doing really well up until a few days ago. Nothing has changed and we haven’t been reported for anything. Only thing I can think of is sometimes when we run paid ads the platform reduces organic visibility. Curious if that’s the case
- **2022-04-20 12:20** *User_8ASVCJ*: Nothing has changed in the last few days on ads, we've been at 1k daily ad spend for a while

- **2023-08-10 15:34** *Elyse*: <!channel> hi all chiming in from OOO - want to be super clear on this. We should not be telling people they can use the sauna blankets and PEMF mat at the same time stacked on top of each other. This has not been tested for safety, and considering the blanket can melt on its own it should not be combined with another heated product. We are dealing with an influencer or affiliate or someone telling people they can do so and trying to clarify on customer service end. \n\n*Reactions: :+1: User_8ASVCJ*

- **2025-02-19 11:43** *Elyse*: What are you seeing @Anastasia 
- **2025-02-19 11:44** *Elyse*: We monitor Facebook and IG daily

- **2025-02-19 12:35** *Elyse*: @Anastasia can you send examples of what you’re looking at pls!
- **2025-02-19 12:36** *Elyse*: CS agents and I handle community engagement in terms of monitoring and responding to comments, DMs on Facebook and IG. I think what you’re talking about might be more in @María José Castro ‘s world? Unsure
- **2025-02-19 12:43** *María José Castro*: @Elyse yes! will take a look at recent tags

- **2025-06-12 12:08** *Anastasia*: <!channel> who ever is in charge of community management, please make sure to reply to comments under posts. [https://www.instagram.com/p/DKufaHmRhzG/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/p/DKufaHmRhzG/?hl=en) it's good for our engagement, and also to answer questions that potential customers have.
- **2025-06-12 12:18** *Thila*: Hey @Anastasia - just a heads up that we’re not seeing these comments in Kustomer. We’ll keep the convo in MBS for now, and I’ll get our CS-social team to assist with this
- **2025-06-12 14:01** *Elyse*: @Anastasia @María José Castro for your context  
• we have facebook and instagram comments integrated with our customer service platform Kustomer  
• Facebook comments and DMs flow directly into our CS box  
• Instagram doesn’t integrate as cleanly, so we typically check these on the meta business suite  
• Social is monitored daily with special attention to any customer questions or order-related comments and general engagement secondary.
- **2025-06-12 14:01** *Elyse*: It seems like we stopped receiving Instagram comments through Kustomer around late April so we’ve been trying to get it reconnected.\n\n*Reactions: :+1::skin-tone-3: Thila*
- **2025-06-12 14:02** *Elyse*: In the meantime, the agents are working directly through the Meta business suite to answer comments and DMs\n\n*Reactions: :+1::skin-tone-3: Thila*
- **2025-06-12 14:02** *Elyse*: @María José Castro @Fiona Hillery you can skip answering the general engagement ones and let us tackle those, to avoid any duplicate responses\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Thila*
- **2025-06-12 14:49** *María José Castro*: thanks for the info!
- **2025-07-07 12:04** *Thila*: @María José Castro Not sure if you can assist with this but the Recovery bundle with Normatec boots is still being advertised on IG. Are you able to deactivate this?
