- **2025-06-18 11:43** *Jourdan*: Hey @Laura, Sorry for not getting back to you sooner via email but wanted to follow up in slack for quick communication. Ingrid did emphasize meeting with you is important to provide input on the next creative briefs going out so would love to jump on tomorrow or friday if you have availability?
- **2025-06-18 13:50** *Laura*: Hi! all good, i'm sure you're busy with onboarding stuff!
- **2025-06-18 13:51** *Laura*: I can do 11-11:30 am on Friday?
- **2025-06-18 13:53** *Laura*: Sharma should have added you to a call on friday morning - we are needing to have a weekly creative briefing with them because there are still some inconsistencies. No action from your side for these, but might helpful to listen in
- **2025-06-23 11:33** *Jourdan*: Morning! I put together a list of Creative insights  from a SEO &amp; GA4 Analysis i put together  
  
[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CW9r4*7aJyZfa450xJVPekNZSD-sCaDL5b6r1UmCyT0/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CW9r4*7aJyZfa450xJVPekNZSD-sCaDL5b6r1UmCyT0/edit?usp=sharing)  
  
The highlights list the actionables from the breakdown but there's more detail below.  
  
Let me know if you have any questions! We can finally jump on that call to discuss :sweat_smile:
- **2025-06-23 14:52** *Laura*: Thanks, I'll take a look. Was this pulled from sharmas reports? Or in platform, or northbeam? 
- **2025-06-23 15:05** *Jourdan*: Pulled from GA4 directly but not sure where SEO came from. Ingrid shared that with me so i think it may have been internal
- **2025-06-23 15:05** *Laura*: ok perf, thanks!!
- **2025-06-26 11:50** *Laura*: Do you have avails to meet tomorrow from 9am-12p pst?
- **2025-06-26 11:51** *Jourdan*: Yes ma'am anytime works between 9 and 11am 
- **2025-06-26 11:52** *Laura*: Let's do 10-10:30am tomorrow 6/27? I can send an invite in a bit 
- **2025-06-26 11:52** *Jourdan*: Okay sweet that works
- **2025-06-27 09:56** *Jourdan*: Good morning! The invite came through for 7/1 did you still want to chat today
- **2025-06-27 10:06** *Laura*: i had left a note in the invite - i have a conflict, does 7/1 work?
- **2025-06-27 10:06** *Jourdan*: Ahh okay and yes that works
- **2025-07-07 15:29** *Jourdan*: Yo do you need any insights on Top Red Light Hat or Mask Creative?
- **2025-07-07 20:48** *Laura*: Sorry i totally missed this! No I think I'm good - i'll tag you in the brief for your inputs
- **2025-07-07 20:48** *Laura*: thanks!
- **2025-07-08 00:22** *Jourdan*: Okay thank you!
- **2025-07-10 18:43** *Jourdan*: Hey, apologies for the delayed response on your brief. For Red Light Neck Enhancer, did you pick that up from the call or were there other needs for creative there? I ask because Sauna Blanket &amp; PEMF mat are down in sales rev compared to last year and we want to push those but they're not performing well w/ paid media. I'd like to get more creative in the mix there but if that's gonna overload SB or delay their turn around i can push to next week :eyes:
- **2025-07-10 18:46** *Laura*: yes I thought jake said neck enhancer? or maybe I made that up lol, but I think we can maybe test the mask + neck enhancer together, and we also push them together too
- **2025-07-10 18:47** *Laura*: SB is working on blanket, so we can push pemf to next week
- **2025-07-10 18:47** *Laura*: they should have red light hat too since we briefed them on the other week as well
- **2025-07-10 18:47** *Jourdan*: Okay cool that could help with AOV because that's taken a dip as well. I'm aligned with Mask + Neck Enhancer
- **2025-07-10 18:48** *Laura* 💬 1 reply: i also started a CTV brief: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18PoqXx8mISEXosl3032aGPvW5YC3WQHanGR*sG4Bi5E/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18PoqXx8mISEXosl3032aGPvW5YC3WQHanGR*sG4Bi5E/edit?usp=sharing) but we can chat about this next week, i assume it's going to be awarness focused\n\n📎 **HD CTV Brief** (gpres, 0B) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18PoqXx8mISEXosl3032aGPvW5YC3WQHanGR_sG4Bi5E/edit?usp=sharing)
- **2025-07-10 18:48** *Jourdan*: but yeah for sure red light hat that's our winner
- **2025-07-10 18:48** *Laura*: are you aligned to these other products too for a refresh?\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-07-10 at 4.48.31 PM.png** (png, 42.8KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F095C1BF9T6/screenshot_2025-07-10_at_4.48.31___pm.png)
- **2025-07-10 18:49** *Jourdan*: Yes ma'am
- **2025-07-10 18:51** *Laura*: idk if you looked at the YT brief that carly sent through but i did think it was maybe too performanced focused? but once we have specs etc i can provide better messaging
- **2025-07-10 18:53** *Jourdan*: Is this the YT Brief? [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hqw3Np-ZJjCNd2NVxwqdICiAQoyzPBWzfHxTs772j2U/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hqw3Np-ZJjCNd2NVxwqdICiAQoyzPBWzfHxTs772j2U/edit?tab=t.0)
- **2025-07-10 18:54** *Laura*: yes? that's what she sent
- **2025-07-10 18:54** *Laura*: i feel like it was more of a performance report? lol
- **2025-07-10 18:55** *Jourdan*: Lol yeah a bit confusing and they probably need more direction if this is the brief
- **2025-07-10 18:55** *Jourdan*: leaning in to what works organically might make the most sense
- **2025-07-10 18:55** *Jourdan*: Some of those videos move slow for ads though
- **2025-07-10 18:57** *Laura*: yeah
- **2025-07-10 18:58** *Laura*: i haven't finished mine i threw something together last night buuuut once we have more info i can update
- **2025-07-10 18:58** *Jourdan*: Okkkk sounds good
- **2025-07-10 18:58** *Jourdan**: Yeah all awareness and maybe core 4 to start?  I do like that you threw the Full Spectrum Sauna in the mix too.  
  
Red Light Hat &amp; Mask  
PEMF &amp; SB
- **2025-07-10 19:00** *Laura*: yes
- **2025-07-10 19:01** *Laura*: i think it would be cool to have the full size in there too but whatever you land on just lmk
- **2025-07-10 19:01** *Laura*: lauren does have interest in adding some of our topicals into things usually, but we ask ingrid
- **2025-07-10 19:04** *Jourdan*: Yeah definitely and get people started on that customer journey. Consideration cycle on Full spectrum sauna will be long so could be a good start for people to research the product
- **2025-07-10 19:04** *Laura*: yeah agree
- **2025-07-10 19:04** *Jourdan*: and i spoke with a CTV partner today and they had a case study with Laneige's lip sleeping mask so seems like it can work with Low AOV products too
- **2025-07-10 19:04** *Laura*: i think we'd need to have other ads ready to go if we do launch with CTV
- **2025-07-10 19:04** *Laura*: oh nice
- **2025-07-10 19:05** *Jourdan*: Yeah deff will need to have full spectrum funnel and resources built out a bit to capitalize
- **2025-07-10 20:13** *Jourdan**: Hey @Laura Ingrid said we should focus on more red light had and PEMF for tomorrow's brief and for CTV start with lifestyle and core 4 then add full size and topicals when the channel becomes proven
- **2025-07-10 20:14** *Laura*: okay
- **2025-07-10 20:14** *Laura*: does she not want any of the other products?
- **2025-07-10 20:14** *Laura*: we should be getting more pemf by eow bc we briefed them last week
- **2025-07-10 20:18** *Laura*: if she is online we can also start a group slack lol
- **2025-07-10 20:21** *Jourdan*: lol yeah group slack might be easiest to align us all. Although she did just respond so keep lets keep focus on Red Light Hat, Mask, PEMF, and SB for this week so we can get rev up. Then push Endorphin oil + sweat band, trans mag spray, and press to next week because she said they're good entry points to the brand.
- **2025-07-10 20:22** *Laura*: does she know we have all of that coming too? or does she want us to brief 2 weeks in a row on that?
- **2025-07-10 20:22** *Laura*: specifically for SB
- **2025-07-10 20:25** *Jourdan**: Yeah she knows. Applying pressure on core 4 because performance is down and those products are proven to convert at KPI with paid media
- **2025-07-11 08:14** *Chris Jacob* 💬 1 reply: FYI we had a sale on Nordstrom for sauna blankets which sold 150 units over the past three days so maybe some effect on DTC\n\n*Reactions: :orange_heart: User_7DB7H9, Rahul, Ingrid*
- **2025-07-11 11:38** *User_TS27JN*: Hey @Jourdan happy Friday! Please see [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i0FND-8p7CjiRzOjRk0AFC7nRfWXxWwSbYZHzLhYf1A/edit?usp=sharing) for our Tiktok relationship to the other channels and business as a whole. Happy to pull anymore numbers and explain this further anytime. Definitely some interesting insights here! We are prepared to take action on turning off the SPC and launching a red light mask specific funnel, but decided to hold for feedback. Let us know what you think. Thank you and have a great weekend! CC @Berkeley Clark
- **2025-07-11 13:19** *Ingrid*: excuse me for stating the obvious but we are also on the last day of prime week (4 days this year) so that would also account for slowness in the DTC front\n\n*Reactions: :+1: User_7DB7H9*

- **2025-07-15 13:51** *Jake Panzer*: Hey @Ingrid @Jourdan @Chris Jacob, more good news! I've managed to get most of our bundles approved on GMC, which were previously flagged as having promotional imagery and were disapproved. The fix of adding a supplemental feed with the new image links (without the promo stickers) worked :relaxed:  
  
The Sauna Blanket Starter Kit is still disapproved but I have requested a review from GMC. Will keep an eye here and let you guys know once it's approved too.  
  
I also noticed that the Summer Travel Glow Kit is missing on GMC. I can work on getting it added although I might need some clarity as to who manages the current product feeds on GMC. I've attached a screenshot of the feeds (data sources) connected to GMC. Once I know who currently manages them, I can work closely with them to get the new bundle added and make any further optis.

- **2025-07-15 14:08** *Jake Panzer* 💬 7 replies: I was actually referring to [this summer bundle](https://higherdose.com/products/summer-travel-glow-kit), @Chris Jacob. The other one you shared is all set now since I passed the supplemental feed to fix the issue. We can ignore the one from the Canada feed for now since we don't have any campaigns delivering there.  
Would love to get a quick call on the books with you this week to walk through the current feed setup so I can get fully caught up.

- **2025-07-17 13:06** *Jourdan**: Hey, im following up with Gui and need clarity around % of revenue  
  
"What percentage of your revenue comes from D2C, retail, and marketplace"  
  
W/ 36M on Shopify last 12 months I'm assuming retail and marketplace accounts are tracked off platform?  
Is it safe to say those 2 make up 20% of the total rev?\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
    - **2025-07-17 22:49** *Jourdan*: ↳ Okay sounds good @Jake Panzer send an update and i should be able to get you more spend from the other channels\n\n*Reactions: :saluting_face: Jake Panzer*
- **2025-07-18 09:19** *Chris Jacob*: **<!channel>** we have begun domain hosting transfer this may cause interruptions in a variety of ways. If you face any tech issues at all please advise me here and if I don't respond to my personal email/phone as higherdose email could be interrupted\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Rahul, Jake Panzer*
- **2025-07-18 11:11** *Jourdan**: I think the tool is valuable but felt like we weren't strong in the same areas they are like Retail &amp; Amazon.  
  
Although seems like there might be opportunities with brij to track retail sales, do list building, and the rebate thing seemed interesting but agreed big business decision.\n\n*Reactions: :bangbang: Ari Murray*

- **2025-07-18 12:07** *Jake Panzer* 💬 11 replies: Hey @Jourdan @Ingrid – sharing a quick update on the ***PMax scaling test***, since today marks the end of the 30-day test window (June 19 to July 17).  
  
*Overall, scaling results look promising.*  
**Here's a breakdown based on *Northbeam 1DC data* (Jun 19–Jul 17 vs. previous period):**  
• *Non-Brand PEMF PMax* up 131% in revenue | 1.68 ROAS (+20%) | *NB 1DC*  
• *Non-Brand Sauna Blanket PMax* up 40% in revenue | 1.60 ROAS (-33%) | *NB 1DC*  
• *Non-Brand Red Light PMax* up 43% in revenue | 1.58 ROAS (+1%) | *NB 1DC*  
Note: The previous period included the *Body Sculptor launch and Father's Day sale*, so we're comparing against an inflated baseline.  
  
**From *Google in-platform data for Pmax* (Jun 19–Jul 10 vs. previous period):**  
• Impressions up 19%  
• Clicks up +35%  
• CTR up +14%  
• CPV down -14%  
• Revenue down -41% (likely due to the stronger comparison period)  
The drop in CPV supports what Google mentioned about PMax leaning more into *Top-of-Funnel placements like YouTube*, which helps build awareness efficiently.  
  
***Recommendation:***  
Let's maintain current PMax budget levels, given the incremental revenue in 3 of the 5 scaled campaigns and clear improvements in traffic quality.  
  
***Budget note*** cc: @Jourdan @Ingrid:  
We're currently pacing about **$30K over the $100K Google budget** for July. This was expected, as we committed to running the **30-day PMax scaling test** through its full cycle.  
We've noticed that the **influencer platform is under-pacing** against July budgets. Let us know if we can reallocate from there to help absorb the Google overage.  
If you'd like us to **scale further into top-performing PMax campaigns**, we're happy to — but we'd need an **additional ~$2,800** for the rest of the month to do so.  
Let us know how you'd like us to move forward.  
Thanks! cc: @Berkeley Clark @Rahul @Ari Murray
- **2025-07-18 13:29** *Jourdan*: Hey @Jake Panzer thank you for the update and all the context that's super helpful.  
  
We're still down 9% YoY and since Google is the primary channel we don't want to pull back if anything I want to keep pushing budgets on Google since we're down 23% in spend Last 7.  
  
Do you have insights into why budget is pulling back?  
  
  
CC: @Rahul I also see some under performing campaigns on Meta like PEMF and Sauna Blanket that we could reduce spend on, shift budget to other performing campaigns, or shift the budget to google.  
  
I'd love to know both of your thoughts so we can keep pushing revenue up.  
  
I know we're up against a few challenges compared to last year but we're not too far behind on rev.\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
    - **2025-07-18 13:32** *Rahul*: ↳ Read my mind @Jourdan - just published our last retargeting ad set and optimizing the budget as we speak! I'll shoot over the new budget shortly
    - **2025-07-18 13:34** *Jourdan*: ↳ Thank you sir! What else besides creative do you think would be helpful to get those 2 products performing again?
    - **2025-07-18 13:35** *Rahul*: ↳ Honestly for the time being it's all creative! new campaign is still less than 2 weeks old and i think getting some new batches in will make a huge difference
    - **2025-07-18 13:35** *Rahul*: ↳ Updated budget $3075/day @Jourdan!
    - **2025-07-18 13:45** *Jourdan*: ↳ Okay thanks for that @Rahul  
  
@Jake Panzer that'll give you more than the $2800 of wiggle room on Google. With a continued push in spend do you think'll it will exceed what Jake cut?

- **2025-07-10 18:47** *Jourdan**: Okay cool that could help with AOV because that's taken a dip as well. I'm aligned with Mask + Neck Enhancer
- **2025-07-10 18:48** *Laura* 💬 1 reply: i also started a CTV brief: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18PoqXx8mISEXosl3032aGPvW5YC3WQHanGR*sG4Bi5E/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18PoqXx8mISEXosl3032aGPvW5YC3WQHanGR*sG4Bi5E/edit?usp=sharing) but we can chat about this next week, i assume it's going to be awarness focused\n\n📎 **HD CTV Brief** (gpres, 0B) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18PoqXx8mISEXosl3032aGPvW5YC3WQHanGR_sG4Bi5E/edit?usp=sharing)
- **2025-07-10 18:48** *Jourdan**: but yeah for sure red light hat that's our winner
- **2025-07-10 18:48** *Laura*: are you aligned to these other products too for a refresh?\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-07-10 at 4.48.31 PM.png** (png, 42.8KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F095C1BF9T6/screenshot_2025-07-10_at_4.48.31___pm.png)
- **2025-07-10 18:49** *Jourdan*: Yes ma'am
- **2025-07-10 18:51** *Laura*: idk if you looked at the YT brief that carly sent through but i did think it was maybe too performanced focused? but once we have specs etc i can provide better messaging
- **2025-07-10 18:53** *Jourdan*: Is this the YT Brief? [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hqw3Np-ZJjCNd2NVxwqdICiAQoyzPBWzfHxTs772j2U/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hqw3Np-ZJjCNd2NVxwqdICiAQoyzPBWzfHxTs772j2U/edit?tab=t.0)
- **2025-07-10 18:54** *Laura*: yes? that's what she sent
- **2025-07-10 18:54** *Laura*: i feel like it was more of a performance report? lol
- **2025-07-10 18:55** *Jourdan*: Lol yeah a bit confusing and they probably need more direction if this is the brief
- **2025-07-10 18:55** *Jourdan**: leaning in to what works organically might make the most sense
- **2025-07-10 18:55** *Jourdan**: Some of those videos move slow for ads though
- **2025-07-10 18:57** *Laura*: yeah
- **2025-07-10 18:58** *Laura*: i haven't finished mine i threw something together last night buuuut once we have more info i can update
- **2025-07-10 18:58** *Jourdan**: Okkkk sounds good
- **2025-07-10 18:58** *Jourdan**: Yeah all awareness and maybe core 4 to start?  I do like that you threw the Full Spectrum Sauna in the mix too.  
  
Red Light Hat &amp; Mask  
PEMF &amp; SB
- **2025-07-10 19:00** *Laura*: yes
- **2025-07-10 19:01** *Laura*: i think it would be cool to have the full size in there too but whatever you land on just lmk
- **2025-07-10 19:01** *Laura*: lauren does have interest in adding some of our topicals into things usually, but we ask ingrid
- **2025-07-10 19:04** *Jourdan**: Yeah definitely and get people started on that customer journey. Consideration cycle on Full spectrum sauna will be long so could be a good start for people to research the product
- **2025-07-10 19:04** *Laura*: yeah agree
- **2025-07-10 19:04** *Jourdan**: and i spoke with a CTV partner today and they had a case study with Laneige's lip sleeping mask so seems like it can work with Low AOV products too
- **2025-07-10 19:04** *Laura*: i think we'd need to have other ads ready to go if we do launch with CTV
- **2025-07-10 19:04** *Laura*: oh nice
- **2025-07-10 19:05** *Jourdan**: Yeah deff will need to have full spectrum funnel and resources built out a bit to capitalize
- **2025-07-10 20:13** *Jourdan**: Hey @Laura Ingrid said we should focus on more red light had and PEMF for tomorrow's brief and for CTV start with lifestyle and core 4 then add full size and topicals when the channel becomes proven
- **2025-07-10 20:14** *Laura*: okay
- **2025-07-10 20:14** *Laura*: does she not want any of the other products?
- **2025-07-10 20:14** *Laura*: we should be getting more pemf by eow bc we briefed them last week
- **2025-07-10 20:18** *Laura*: if she is online we can also start a group slack lol
- **2025-07-10 20:21** *Jourdan**: lol yeah group slack might be easiest to align us all. Although she did just respond so keep lets keep focus on Red Light Hat, Mask, PEMF, and SB for this week so we can get rev up. Then push Endorphin oil + sweat band, trans mag spray, and press to next week because she said they're good entry points to the brand.
- **2025-07-10 20:22** *Laura*: does she know we have all of that coming too? or does she want us to brief 2 weeks in a row on that?
- **2025-07-10 20:22** *Laura*: specifically for SB
- **2025-07-10 20:25** *Jourdan**: Yeah she knows. Applying pressure on core 4 because performance is down and those products are proven to convert at KPI with paid media
- **2025-07-16 09:50** *Chris Jacob**: You are getting invites to Buxton, this is through elevar based on our Ga4 data they output Personas, limited in scope but Buxton is the go to in the health and wellness industry for demographic data if hepful
- **2025-07-16 12:43** *Ingrid*: yep, just signed up!
- **2025-07-16 12:44** *Ingrid*: I saw "Scount" in the workspace, what is that?
- **2025-07-16 20:07** *Jourdan*: Yo! Who all from SB needs to be on the bark call? @Jake Panzer
- **2025-07-16 20:56** *Chris Jacob*: where do you see that

- **2025-07-17 13:39** *Ingrid**: i did this this morning
- **2025-07-17 13:40** *Ingrid**: they are forcing a call, which i think is part of the onbaording anyway
- **2025-07-17 13:40** *Ingrid**: like it wont let me just verify
- **2025-07-17 13:40** *Ingrid* 💬 1 reply: will it let you, Jourdan?
- **2025-07-17 13:40** *Ingrid**: i accepted the inputs earlier
- **2025-07-17 13:40** *Chris Jacob**: i have ability to do so i think?

- **2025-07-17 13:41** *Ingrid**: try?
- **2025-07-17 13:42** *Chris Jacob**: goes to this but then still doesnt unlock that stuff
- **2025-07-17 13:42** *Chris Jacob**: so probably

- **2025-07-17 13:46** *Chris Jacob**: was referring to mismatch in this time period but its actually northbeam thats lower than prescient, which matches the platform\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-17 13:48** *Jourdan**: Yeah NB would be lower than prescient because NB wasn't implemented last year\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-18 11:11** *Jourdan**: I think the tool is valuable but felt like we weren't strong in the same areas they are like Retail &amp; Amazon.  
  
Although seems like there might be opportunities with brij to track retail sales, do list building, and the rebate thing seemed interesting but agreed big business decision.\n\n*Reactions: :bangbang: Ari Murray*
- **2025-07-18 11:22** *Jourdan**: Also updating packaging to include or update QR codes would  be a big decision\n\n*Reactions: :bangbang: Ari Murray*
- **2025-07-18 11:22** *Jourdan**: I agree that would need to be positioned differently for it to land well\n\n*Reactions: :pray: Ari Murray*
- **2025-07-22 07:06** *Chris Jacob* �� 1 reply: I believe it would affect the accrual data too but not sure how often you need to reference historical periods. I'm not fully sure but I think that if you look at X report this week/month as you do, and then access it again in a couple months the nubmers will have changed
- **2025-07-22 07:06** *Chris Jacob* 💬 5 replies: @Jourdan we need to align on the use of Bark vs something else because I have concerns about their data and noted you mentioned needing to talk to them with Sharma.  I need a fuller understanding of what they are providing that other platforms aren't to decide if we're going to keep using them
    - **2025-07-22 09:26** *Jourdan*: ↳ Yeah there's an overlap of metrics between all the platforms we use. I think contribution margin by product and profit per view are nice to see with the granularity they provide. The platform does offer a lot of insights but I'm not sure how helpful the data is to everyone else. The intent behind meeting with sharma and bark is to lock in target CAC numbers by product for each channel. Do you want to get added to the call? 
    - **2025-07-22 10:31** *Chris Jacob*: ↳ @Jourdan we ran out of time on call I think my preference is a short call  with you and whoever at Sharma to understand ideal needs and go from there - I am not comfortable at this moment making any business decisions with what Bark says. But for this specific topic they would also not be the "keeper" of something like the simple margins on a product thats all coming from me for them to just plug in
    - **2025-07-22 11:44** *Jourdan*: ↳ Yeah those paid media calls are super tight with time. Okay yeah then maybe that conversation is better suited with you overall instead of Bark :eyes:  
  
Would you prefer a new slack group or email to schedule out a time to talk? @Chris Jacob
    - **2025-07-22 12:38** *Chris Jacob*: ↳ My calendar is correct feel free to slot in whenever from tomorrow on
    - **2025-07-23 13:28** *Jourdan*: ↳ Thanks for that I'll share that with sharma team. Other than our MTA tools do you know if we're using anything else that has crossover with bark reporting? @Chris Jacob

    - **2025-08-01 07:33** *Rahul Vithanage*: ↳ I was actually referring to consolidating search campaigns Jourdan - one primary campaign for brand and another for non-brand vs. having multiple. This way we can combine budgets which are currently fragmented and enter the auction house more competitively with higher budgets.  
Regarding product performance, are you referring to a report that you created on Google?
