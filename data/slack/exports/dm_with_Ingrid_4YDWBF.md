- **2025-06-24 15:52** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good. Are we close to launching Youtube? I remember mentions from one of the calls this week but not a timeline
- **2025-06-24 15:53** *Ingrid*: Yes! It’s in creative optimization as we speak

- **2025-06-24 16:08** *Ingrid*: I’ll setup time for us so we can chat through budgeting for the rest of the year and see how we can fit in a test here
- **2025-06-24 16:23** *Jourdan*: Okay thank you
- **2025-06-24 16:23** *Jourdan*: how do i see amazon performance? I don’t see it as a line item in North Beam
- **2025-06-25 11:11** *Ingrid*: let's go through Amazon stuff together when we chat tomororw
- **2025-06-25 11:12** *Ingrid*: I also want to make sure you're able to join that Decile call today at 1pm, would love you to own that data and relationship, I think it's powerful and I never had the time to unlock it properly

- **2025-06-25 13:03** *Jourdan*: Decile had a lot of interesting insights around customer data. Perfect tool to use for figuring out Paid Hero products and which lead to higher LTV
- **2025-06-25 13:03** *Jourdan*: The highdration kit was not on my radar at all
- **2025-06-25 13:03** *Ingrid*: yes! ok yea def dig into how we operationalize the decile data
- **2025-06-25 13:04** *Ingrid*: the highdraytion powder is gross imo
- **2025-06-25 13:04** *Ingrid*: we need a new formulation lol
- **2025-06-25 13:05** *Jourdan*: I think most have been given away for free at this point.  22% customer share ratio and and crazy 1st time rev so i feel like people we’re buying other products and this was a free gift + purchase item\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-25 at 11.04.43.png** (png, 190.7KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F093FM9AAKB/screenshot_2025-06-25_at_11.04.43.png)

- **2025-06-30 11:21** *Ingrid*: cool no prob
- **2025-06-30 11:39** *Jourdan*: So iffy on pinterest platform reporting but thats based in bias on previous experiences. Im open to exploring here just need reporting based on in platform 1 day attribution to make decisions

- **2025-06-30 17:39** *Jourdan*: working on individual months now
- **2025-06-30 17:42** *Jourdan*: Is the 1.6 m on $350k in spend is for all paid channels and is that Shopify Rev only?
- **2025-06-30 17:43** *Jourdan*: Basically should i update sales goal on july tab to 1.6 m because i see spend is at $350k
- **2025-06-30 20:49** *Ingrid*: Well let’s discuss it and align to a reasonable but but stretch goal to get everyone focused 
- **2025-06-30 20:50** *Ingrid*: I’ll review the doc tomorrow and then we can catch about H2 budgets and goals to make sure we are tracking to where we need to be on both spend and sales 
- **2025-06-30 20:52** *Jourdan*: Okay awesome I’ll work on individual months so we have some starting projections to work with 
- **2025-06-30 20:52** *Ingrid*: Perfect, thank you!
- **2025-07-01 09:35** *Ingrid*: hey jourdan are you joining the sharma call?
- **2025-07-01 10:39** *Ingrid*: hey, I don't see the media and performance summary in the weekly deck yet and it's due each monday EOD - how can I help make sure this is complete?
- **2025-07-01 11:35** *Jourdan*: Ahh so sorry that slipped my mind yesterday. I’ll create a reminder on my calendar to complete EOD. I’ll start updating it now \n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-01 11:45** *Jourdan*: I see its been completed, I’ll keep this same format for next week. I changed it last week and there’s a handful of new metrics that people may not be familiar with
- **2025-07-01 11:56** *Ingrid*: ok great - can you do one that is H1 now that it's over?
- **2025-07-01 11:57** *Jourdan*: So DTC performance recap from Jan to June right?
- **2025-07-01 12:00** *Ingrid*: Yes please 
- **2025-07-01 13:17** *Jourdan*: Updated Summaries with projections
- **2025-07-01 13:17** *Jourdan*: Used previous years growth and applied to sales and spend to get 2025 projections
- **2025-07-01 13:18** *Jourdan*: I left a formula key but if it doesn’t make sense let me know
- **2025-07-01 13:18** *Jourdan*: I could also project based on avg growth since 2023
- **2025-07-01 13:19** *Jourdan*: Also updated the YTD table to give data up until the quarter we’re viewing. So Q3 doesn’t include Q4  and Q2 doesn’t include Q3
- **2025-07-01 13:21** *Jourdan*: and added an efficiency column so we can track total return. I think these numbers will need to be played with a bit because efficiency takes a hit if we model it after last years growth
- **2025-07-01 13:21** *Ingrid*: yea def need to adjsut these a lot
- **2025-07-01 13:22** *Ingrid*: the goal I have for total 2025 is 20% Growth	22%	5%	$8,307,513	$37,083,320

- **2025-07-01 13:22** *Ingrid*: yours is on top and my goal are on bottom
- **2025-07-01 13:23** *Ingrid*: with the highlighted being the key goal
- **2025-07-01 13:24** *Ingrid*: the previous years data is all over the place so not the best guideline
- **2025-07-01 13:24** *Jourdan*: Okay cool cool adjusting now
- **2025-07-01 13:24** *Ingrid*: thank you!
- **2025-07-01 13:24** *Jourdan*: You’re welcome
- **2025-07-01 19:57** *Jourdan*: Made those updates. Spend in Q1 Summary didn’t reflect Affiliate spend so i updated that. If you check Q4 summary the totals are inline with your projections
- **2025-07-01 19:57** *Jourdan*: We just have to get super efficient the remainder of the year
- **2025-07-01 20:00** *Jourdan*: Moving to EOM and H1 reports 
- **2025-07-02 14:05** *Jourdan*: Are you familiar with the disruptors program at Meta?
- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Ingrid*: hi! im not - but tell me about it!
- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Ingrid*: also - i need to skip the call with Bark, which is fine bc it's. good for you to meet them anyway and have them walk you through the platform
- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Ingrid*: i need to do amazon stuff with chris
- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Jourdan*: Okay no worries! I’ll get up to speed with them\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-02 14:23** *Jourdan*: Disruptors is Meta’s high level rep program. You get access to new products, have a rep with more leverage to get things done, run hold out test etc. Kinda gave me the vibes we had on the google call. Not sure if we’re in a special program there but i was surprised at the knowledge and access to tools.  You do have to qualify from a spend perspective over a quarter and I can assume Sharma has some brands in the program
- **2025-07-02 14:23** *Jourdan*: I’ve worked with 2 brands in it and it was a good experience. I’ll ask the team in one of our chats
- **2025-07-02 14:25** *Ingrid*: can you ask Sharma to get us into the program?
- **2025-07-02 14:27** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am for sure
- **2025-07-02 15:26** *Ingrid*: hey let me know when you're off with Bark
- **2025-07-02 15:26** *Ingrid*: I have more questions about these spreadsheet inputs
- **2025-07-02 15:27** *Jourdan*: I’m off call with them. Pretty useful platform to help navigate which products to put more creative and paid resources behind based on profit per view 
- **2025-07-02 15:27** *Jourdan*: Free for questions 
- **2025-07-02 15:29** *Ingrid*: ok cool - calling you now

- **2025-07-03 15:30** *Jourdan*: Hmm ok ok it might include other channels since it’s paid social. I can check other channels for that time too
- **2025-07-03 15:32** *Ingrid*: he has it broken out as just meta - it's ok dont spin your wheels on this one
- **2025-07-03 15:32** *Ingrid*: i had a good long chat with Ari about changing all our campaigns to product funnels
- **2025-07-03 15:33** *Ingrid*: she is fully onboard and we can revisit on monday when we all chat
- **2025-07-03 15:34** *Jourdan*: Okay sweet, I followed up with Jake and he echoed that. They’ll kick it off next week he just wanted to align with SB team
- **2025-07-03 15:34** *Ingrid*: perf
- **2025-07-03 15:34** *Ingrid*: thank you! yea - we'll then need to adjust all our reporting and KPIS, yay
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Jourdan*: Didn’t want to kick anything new off over 4th of July weekend. Would be nice to have produce specific goals too 
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Ingrid*: maybe take a stab at a new way to track all that - I'm still going to track the total business like we are doing, but on a daily/weekly we need to have Sharma report differently on pacing and performance
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Ingrid*: ha same minds
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Jourdan*: Yesss lol it’ll make narrowing down to needle movers much easier 
- **2025-07-03 15:36** *Ingrid*: I'm going to work on a doc for how I am thinking about seperating
- **2025-07-03 15:36** *Ingrid*: and then share with you
- **2025-07-03 15:42** *Ingrid*: will also give us a clean way to create a funnel for the full size sauna
- **2025-07-03 15:42** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good! Do we have any sales resources to take phone calls to sell that?
- **2025-07-07 14:50** *Ingrid*: Hey - I may be a few minutes late to the 1pm with Sharma - go ahead without me and I’ll call you after 
- **2025-07-07 14:50** *Ingrid*: Mainly want to make sure we are on track with the reconfiguration of the product funnels 
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good. Google performance looks solid with increase MTD but getting concenred about Meta CAC mtd. L7 looks okay but its ballooned and ill get an update on single product camps
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Ingrid*: I’m just at the dr and he is running late 
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Jourdan*: Okkkk! I hope everything is okay
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Ingrid*: Oh yea just a checkup 
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Jourdan*: Sounds good! Talk to you in a bit
- **2025-07-07 14:52** *Ingrid*: Also gentle reminder to do you performance marketing and DTC summary today
- **2025-07-07 14:52** *Jourdan*: Yesss ma’am saw the update come through (From Elyse) and have my calendar event\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-07 14:52** *Ingrid*: I’ll setup a weekly for us at 11am Mondays to review everything starting next week
- **2025-07-07 15:29** *Jourdan*: Call wrapped just some quick notes until we chat.  
  
• Campaigns shifted to single product by Wed EOD   
    ◦ Killing Legacy Campaigns (Holding Us Back)  
• Using Product Sets vs All Products in Meta Catalogs  
    ◦ Issue popped up w/ a bundle being served on IG that’s not avail on website.   
    ◦ Solution 1: Turn off product in Catalog so it doesn’t serve in Feed  
    ◦ Solution 2: Change in Shopify so there’s no chance of Shopify settings overruling Meta settings and showing the product as avail   
    ◦ Solution 3: Use Custom Product sets in Ads Manager featuring the Core 4. Could help w/ AOV and only serve DPA ads to high quality audiences which could lift performance on catalog campaigns.   
    ◦ I vote for Solution 2 and 3. SB doesn’t have ability to change on their end so this will need to be an internal update.   
• We’ve got a lot creative for PEMF and Sauna Blanket and some for Red Light Mask but could use more and not enough for Hat. Laura agreed to increase briefs for Hat &amp; Mask this week to be ready for Friday’s call. \n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-07 15:32** *Ingrid*: Agree - I like solution 3
- **2025-07-08 00:11** *Jourdan*: Here’s the written weekly report [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?usp=sharing)
- **2025-07-08 00:11** *Jourdan*: Elyse’s doc was updated earlier today
- **2025-07-08 00:12** *Jourdan*: I can include screenshots from Bark AI as those are inline with some of the images the previous GS provided
- **2025-07-08 09:59** *Jourdan*: If we’re not serving YT primarily then we may need to run some exclusions if possible. Not sure how i feel about these ads serving in Gmail and being effective
- **2025-07-08 10:00** *Jourdan*: Reminds me of an audience network placement on meta
- **2025-07-08 10:06** *Ingrid*: yea agree - bring it up on the google call?
- **2025-07-08 10:06** *Ingrid*: def chase jeremy
- **2025-07-08 10:07** *Ingrid*: thanks for staying on top of that - reviewing your summary now!
- **2025-07-08 10:08** *Jourdan*: You’re welcome! I just reached out to him. TT is the bad apple and if we can’t get it right i rather pull spend down and reallocate to AWIN or Google\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-08 10:08** *Jourdan*: AWIN looks juiiiiccyy with 35% increase in spend\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-08 10:25** *Ingrid*: yea we gave that channel the july 4th deal that only existed for affiliates!
- **2025-07-09 11:08** *Ingrid*: this would be compared to MNTN obviously
- **2025-07-09 11:09** *Ingrid*: need to evaluate which is better
- **2025-07-09 11:09** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am we’re on same page\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-09 11:09** *Jourdan*: Would be good to ask creative questions while we have them too\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-09 11:19** *Ingrid*: this is cool bc it's affilaite/sales based
- **2025-07-09 11:19** *Jourdan*: Could run both MNTN and this with them having two different goals
- **2025-07-09 11:20** *Jourdan*: Just curious what kind of offers they run on these channels w/ promos and QRs not being super effecitve
- **2025-07-09 11:21** *Ingrid*: yea, i guess my worry would be running them at the same time would inflate impact on both
- **2025-07-09 11:21** *Jourdan*: Yeah attribution could get muddy here since there’s no last touch
- **2025-07-09 11:22** *Ingrid*: word - let's pick one to start with then add the other
- **2025-07-09 11:22** *Ingrid*: let me know which you think is best to start
- **2025-07-09 11:23** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good. I’m 50/50 because there’s a lot of learnings to leverage from affiliates
- **2025-07-09 11:26** *Ingrid*: let's see what an adequest test budget would be
- **2025-07-09 11:26** *Ingrid*: we know MNTN is like 10-15k
- **2025-07-09 11:27** *Ingrid*: adequate*
- **2025-07-09 11:27** *Ingrid*: ah 15k
- **2025-07-09 11:28** *Jourdan*: Seems like we might get more bang for a buck with the $15k spent
- **2025-07-09 11:28** *Ingrid*: can you send the answers to these questions to her once she sends?
- **2025-07-09 11:29** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am
- **2025-07-09 13:39** *Jourdan*: Hey, just to keep you updated. Talked to Rahul  & Tori about scaling Google and adjusting T ROAS.  
  
We’re going to adjust T ROAS (15% Recommended by Google Rep) first. Continue w/ budget scale test for 30 days which ends 6.19.  
  
However a few campaigns aren’t scaling incrementally so we’ll make a judgement call on 6.19 to reduce spend.
- **2025-07-09 13:41** *Jourdan*: My thoughts… We push Google &amp; AWIN making Google our primary channel for spend while reducing dependency on Meta until we can meet a sub $800 CAC (1d, 1st time) KPI there. Already seeing this happen L30 with Google taking 35% of spend vs 31% on Meta. Ultimately we gotta get Meta more efficient so we don’t stress Google to hard and blow up CAC there’s a balance we need
- **2025-07-09 13:48** *Ingrid*: fully aligned and really appreciate the input and judgement call\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Jourdan*
- **2025-07-10 16:31** *Ingrid*: hey slack me if you need me on the call now
- **2025-07-10 16:31** *Ingrid*: i need to wrap up a few things and have already heard their thing
- **2025-07-10 16:31** *Ingrid*: im here just heads down
- **2025-07-10 16:33** *Jourdan*: Okay yeah no worries
- **2025-07-10 17:07** *Ingrid*: how did it go?
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: Still speaking with her but good so far
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: like the placement options they have
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: DOOH offering is pretty cool too
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: the others didn’t offer
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: Just wrapped
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: Starting recommended budget is a lot higher than the others but they also manage for us
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: $100-150k for 3 months
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: told her to come back with something in the 50-60k for 3 months
- **2025-07-10 17:22** *Jourdan*: They also mentioned canvases that surround the video creative featuring quotes and QR codes
- **2025-07-10 17:23** *Jourdan*: Liked that aspect because gives us the ability to incorporate messaging and give people option to visit website directly but after speaking with TV Scientific doesn’t seem that those are super effective
- **2025-07-10 17:23** *Jourdan*: she mentioned 30s videos as being most successful on their placements so gives a little more time for QR codes but still not that much
- **2025-07-10 17:31** *Ingrid*: ok yea, i def think they are too expensive for us and I'd suggest we start with the other 2
- **2025-07-10 17:31** *Ingrid*: how are our new campaigns doing this week
- **2025-07-10 17:33** *Ingrid*: also, loved your weekly one-pager. can you make one for YTD/H1?
- **2025-07-10 17:33** *Ingrid*: really want your analysis on how the year has been - what's been good, what needs to change, how we prep for H2
- **2025-07-10 17:39** *Ingrid*: i just left a few comments here for you too
- **2025-07-10 17:39** *Ingrid*: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?tab=t.0)\n\n📎 **GS | Weekly Report | 7.7.25** (gdoc, 133.2KB) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?tab=t.0)
- **2025-07-10 17:39** *Jourdan*: Okay yes i can work on the H1 breakdown\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-10 17:43** *Jourdan*: and we’re on day 2 so not a lot of data.  
  
However Red Light Hat is strongest campaign based on in platform data with 2.83 ROAS and $780 AOV  
Red Light Mask has one purchase a .50 ROAS  
PEMF Mat has one conversion at .9 ROAS  
Sauna Blanket has one conversion  at .08 ROAS but low AOV ($70) so i think it tracked a conversion from a different product
- **2025-07-10 17:43** *Jourdan*: $750/day budget across each of those campaigns
- **2025-07-10 17:45** *Jourdan*: I’d give til end of day 3 to assess
- **2025-07-10 17:54** *Ingrid*: ok cool - i LOVE having this level of product data
- **2025-07-10 17:55** *Ingrid*: let's try to move the needle on our YoY growth, down 6% is bad
- **2025-07-10 17:55** *Ingrid*: can you dig in and see where the bleeding is?
- **2025-07-10 18:09** *Jourdan*: Surface level, I’m sure you see this too but CVR is down 52%, AOV down 13%, and Return customer down 10%  although sessions are up 132%. Also seeing discounts higher ($52.7k) this month than last year ($38.7k).  [Discounts](https://admin.shopify.com/store/higherdose/analytics/reports/total*sales*by*product?ql=FROM+sales%0A++SHOW+net*items*sold%2C+gross*sales%2C+discounts%2C+returns%2C+net*sales%2C+taxes%2C%0A++++total*sales%0A++WHERE+product*title+IS+NOT+NULL%0A++GROUP+BY+product*title%2C+product*vendor%2C+product*type+WITH+TOTALS%2C%0A++++PERCENT*CHANGE%0A++SINCE+startOfMonth%280m%29+UNTIL+today%0A++COMPARE+TO+previous*year%0A++ORDER+BY+total*sales+DESC%0A++LIMIT+1000%0AVISUALIZE+total*sales+TYPE+horizontal_bar) doesn’t make sense since we didn’t have 4th of July sale.  
  
Sessions alone could explain CVR since we’re sending more traffic  
  
Sauna Blanket down 32% in Sales Rev but the Kit is up 26% so discrepancy isn’t that large.  
PEMF Pro Mat down 58%  
  
Silver lining, Body Sculptor has 32k in rev which makes up for some of the downtrends from existing products.
- **2025-07-10 18:16** *Jourdan*: How do we correct, push harder on Red Light Hat. Seems to be the most efficient product w/ paid media. This could improve Meta performance and drive more rev. However we need to improve Sauna Blanket and PEMF Mat paid media performance. Could be a creative solution or produce new landing page assets for those products.
- **2025-07-10 18:34** *Ingrid*: Can you please align with Laura for that creative brief due tomorrow
- **2025-07-10 18:34** *Ingrid*: Let’s include everything we need to push these softer comp products 
- **2025-07-10 18:34** *Ingrid*: She said you never go back to her?
- **2025-07-10 18:37** *Jourdan*: Looks like she tagged me in the brief last night (Im CST right now) but I just got back to her with a reply and added in Red Light Hat to her product mix\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-10 18:38** *Jourdan*: From what Jake shared we’ve got more Blanket and PEMF creative than Red Light
- **2025-07-10 18:38** *Jourdan*: however with sales being down we still need resources here to improve efficiency
- **2025-07-10 18:39** *Jourdan* 💬 10 replies: Do we want to focus on the Red Light Neck Enhancer?
- **2025-07-10 19:02** *Jourdan*: What products should we focus on for CTV? I know Core 4 for sure but are there any others we should include?
- **2025-07-10 19:03** *Jourdan*: Laura brought up Full Spectrum Sauna and mentioned Lauren has interest mixing topicals into our efforts  :eyes:
- **2025-07-10 20:12** *Ingrid*: I’d start with lifestyle and core 4 to start, it’s a good intro to the brand 
- **2025-07-10 20:12** *Ingrid*: Then we can add full size and topicals once we prove out the channel on the basics 
- **2025-07-10 20:13** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good
- **2025-07-10 20:13** *Jourdan*: thank you
- **2025-07-10 20:17** *Jourdan*: Okay any interest in Endorphin oil + sweat band, trans mag spray, and press?  
  
These are lower AOV so i assume keeping it to Red Light, PEMF, and SB to get us back on track would be ideal?
- **2025-07-11 17:06** *Ingrid*: Appreciate you being on top of sharma on those campaigns!
- **2025-07-11 17:10** *Jourdan*: Of course! I want to get this thing turned around asap. Meta can be a lot better which will lift the entire ecosystem and make rev targets at efficiency a bit easier. Seeing these segmented by product is so valuable! Thank you for being behind that push as well\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-11 17:23** *Ingrid*: Yes getting meta right will do soooo much 
- **2025-07-11 17:23** *Ingrid*: Go team 
- **2025-07-14 13:03** *Ingrid*: 2 min!
- **2025-07-14 13:06** *Ingrid*: here!
- **2025-07-14 13:06** *Jourdan*: had to run to bathroom
- **2025-07-14 13:06** *Jourdan*: be there in a sec
- **2025-07-14 13:07** *Jourdan*: @Ingrid
- **2025-07-14 13:07** *Ingrid*: ok cool

- **2025-07-14 13:39** *Jourdan*: Last question, are we looking at gross sales or net when looking at YOY?
- **2025-07-14 13:39** *Ingrid*: Net as it’s in Shopify 
- **2025-07-14 13:39** *Ingrid*: Sales after returns and discounts 
- **2025-07-14 13:43** *Jourdan*: Okay net is showing down 3%. It does look like we’ve got a good bit less of discount rev this year compared to last year but returns are up a lot.  
  
I’d expect net to be up YoY but returns make up the money saved with less discount rev.\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-07-14 at 13.38.39.png** (png, 136.7KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F095T0L78TE/screenshot_2025-07-14_at_13.38.39.png)
- **2025-07-14 13:44** *Ingrid*: It’s all solvable with more top line sales
- **2025-07-14 13:44** *Ingrid*: We need more cushion there 
- **2025-07-14 13:45** *Jourdan*: Yeah agreed
- **2025-07-14 13:46** *Jourdan*: we’ve got like a 4 day buffer before Google recommends we bump budgets again. Speaking with Anastasia now on increasing\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-14 13:48** *Ingrid*: Ok cool. I’m going to skip the 1pm sharma call but I’d like you to join and tell them what we jsut discussed (the sales gap, the wanting new top of funnel drivers) and let me know what they say. I’ll be on the tomorrow morning call though of course 
- **2025-07-14 13:48** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good
- **2025-07-15 09:34** *Ingrid*: hey jourdan are you joining this sharma call?
- **2025-07-15 10:48** *Jourdan*: Hey @Ingrid My mom fell this morning and opened her incision so I’ve been on the phone with her ortho’s office figuring out what to do. I’m sorry for the late heads up I’m just a little overwhelmed 
- **2025-07-15 11:14** *Ingrid*: Oh, man I really hope she is ok and I'm glad you're there to help her. Thanks so much for the heads up, I was super concerned!
- **2025-07-15 11:22** *Jourdan*: I think she will be just in a lot of pain. Thankfully her ortho reassured me and we’ll be able to get her to urgent care today so they can close it back up since it was glued. I’ll follow up with Sharma i see they reached out to lock in CAC
- **2025-07-15 11:59** *Ingrid*: ok, glad there is a plan to get her to a better place
- **2025-07-16 13:33** *Jourdan*: Hey I got back to your email and followed up with meta team but they’re in Tel Aviv.   
  
Your mornings next week are a little full but checking to see if you have flexibility for anything morning cst/est after Mon &amp; Tue?
- **2025-07-16 13:57** *Ingrid*: Ah, I'm actually out Mon/Tues next week but I think you and Sharma to should meet them anyway (without me)
- **2025-07-16 13:57** *Ingrid*: so go ahead and book what works for everyone else
- **2025-07-16 14:01** *Jourdan*: Okay I saw you were OOO so sent times that worked with with your schedule but seems like mornings are best for everyone so I’ll follow up with them. \n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*

- **2025-07-17 11:40** *Jourdan*: Yes i was but stepped away to the bathroom so missed that question. Here’s my notes from the convo  
  
**Action Items / Takeaways**  
• Sharma to **move forward with creative concept** focused on starter kits for younger kids.  
• Test **talking head format** with VO as preferred option.  
• Clarify **usage rights** on existing UGC content.  
• Identify assets that align with Ingrid’s vision of **elevated lifestyle and rituals**.  
• Ensure collaboration and **emotional clarity** among key stakeholders to reduce friction.

- **2025-07-17 13:06** *Jourdan*: Hey, im following up with Gui and need clarity around % of revenue  
  
“What percentage of your revenue comes from D2C, retail, and marketplace”  
  
W/ 36M on Shopify last 12 months I’m assuming retail and marketplace accounts are tracked off platform?  
Is it safe to say those 2 make up 20% of the total rev?\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*

- **2025-07-18 11:11** *Jourdan*: I think the tool is valuable but felt like we weren’t strong in the same areas they are like Retail &amp; Amazon.  
  
Although seems like there might be opportunities with brij to track retail sales, do list building, and the rebate thing seemed interesting but agreed big business decision.\n\n*Reactions: :bangbang: Ari Murray*

- **2025-07-18 12:07** *Jake Panzer* 💬 11 replies: Hey @Jourdan @Ingrid – sharing a quick update on the ***PMax scaling test***, since today marks the end of the 30-day test window (June 19 to July 17).  
  
*Overall, scaling results look promising.*  
**Here’s a breakdown based on *Northbeam 1DC data* (Jun 19–Jul 17 vs. previous period):**  
• *Non-Brand PEMF PMax* up 131% in revenue | 1.68 ROAS (+20%) | *NB 1DC*  
• *Non-Brand Sauna Blanket PMax* up 40% in revenue | 1.60 ROAS (-33%) | *NB 1DC*  
• *Non-Brand Red Light PMax* up 43% in revenue | 1.58 ROAS (+1%) | *NB 1DC*  
Note: The previous period included the *Body Sculptor launch and Father’s Day sale*, so we’re comparing against an inflated baseline.  
  
**From *Google in-platform data for Pmax* (Jun 19–Jul 10 vs. previous period):**  
• Impressions up 19%  
• Clicks up +35%  
• CTR up +14%  
• CPV down -14%  
• Revenue down -41% (likely due to the stronger comparison period)  
The drop in CPV supports what Google mentioned about PMax leaning more into *Top-of-Funnel placements like YouTube*, which helps build awareness efficiently.  
  
***Recommendation:***  
Let’s maintain current PMax budget levels, given the incremental revenue in 3 of the 5 scaled campaigns and clear improvements in traffic quality.  
  
***Budget note*** cc: @Jourdan @Ingrid:  
We’re currently pacing about **$30K over the $100K Google budget** for July. This was expected, as we committed to running the **30-day PMax scaling test** through its full cycle.  
We’ve noticed that the **influencer platform is under-pacing** against July budgets. Let us know if we can reallocate from there to help absorb the Google overage.  
If you’d like us to **scale further into top-performing PMax campaigns**, we’re happy to — but we’d need an **additional ~$2,800** for the rest of the month to do so.  
Let us know how you'd like us to move forward.  
Thanks! cc: @Berkeley Clark @Rahul @Ari Murray
- **2025-07-18 13:29** *Jourdan*: Hey @Jake Panzer thank you for the update and all the context that’s super helpful.  
  
We’re still down 9% YoY and since Google is the primary channel we don’t want to pull back if anything I want to keep pushing budgets on Google since we’re down 23% in spend Last 7.  
  
Do you have insights into why budget is pulling back?  
  
  
CC: @Rahul I also see some under performing campaigns on Meta like PEMF and Sauna Blanket that we could reduce spend on, shift budget to other performing campaigns, or shift the budget to google.  
  
I’d love to know both of your thoughts so we can keep pushing revenue up.  
  
I know we’re up against a few challenges compared to last year but we’re not too far behind on rev.\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
    - **2025-07-18 13:32** *Rahul*: ↳ Read my mind @Jourdan - just published our last retargeting ad set and optimizing the budget as we speak! I'll shoot over the new budget shortly
    - **2025-07-18 13:34** *Jourdan*: ↳ Thank you sir! What else besides creative do you think would be helpful to get those 2 products performing again?
    - **2025-07-18 13:35** *Rahul*: ↳ Honestly for the time being it's all creative! new campaign is still less than 2 weeks old and i think getting some new batches in will make a huge difference
    - **2025-07-18 13:35** *Rahul*: ↳ Updated budget $3075/day @Jourdan!
    - **2025-07-18 13:45** *Jourdan*: ↳ Okay thanks for that @Rahul  
  
@Jake Panzer that’ll give you more than the $2800 of wiggle room on Google. With a continued push in spend do you think’ll it will exceed what Jake cut?
    - **2025-07-18 13:46** *Jourdan*: ↳ Thanks for the update @Rahul!\n\n*Reactions: :saluting_face: Rahul, Ingrid*

- **2025-06-24 15:51** *Ingrid*: So we should test both ahead of holiday 
- **2025-06-24 15:52** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good. Are we close to launching Youtube? I remember mentions from one of the calls this week but not a timeline
- **2025-06-24 15:53** *Ingrid*: Yes! It’s in creative optimization as we speak

- **2025-06-25 13:03** *Jourdan*: Decile had a lot of interesting insights around customer data. Perfect tool to use for figuring out Paid Hero products and which lead to higher LTV
- **2025-06-25 13:03** *Jourdan*: The highdration kit was not on my radar at all
- **2025-06-25 13:03** *Ingrid*: yes! ok yea def dig into how we operationalize the decile data
- **2025-06-25 13:04** *Ingrid*: the highdraytion powder is gross imo
- **2025-06-25 13:04** *Ingrid*: we need a new formulation lol
- **2025-06-25 13:05** *Jourdan*: I think most have been given away for free at this point.  22% customer share ratio and and crazy 1st time rev so i feel like people we’re buying other products and this was a free gift + purchase item\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-25 at 11.04.43.png** (png, 190.7KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F093FM9AAKB/screenshot_2025-06-25_at_11.04.43.png)

- **2025-06-30 17:43** *Jourdan*: Basically should i update sales goal on july tab to 1.6 m because i see spend is at $350k
- **2025-06-30 20:49** *Ingrid*: Well let’s discuss it and align to a reasonable but but stretch goal to get everyone focused

- **2025-07-01 13:18** *Jourdan*: I could also project based on avg growth since 2023
- **2025-07-01 13:19** *Jourdan*: Also updated the YTD table to give data up until the quarter we’re viewing. So Q3 doesn’t include Q4  and Q2 doesn’t include Q3
- **2025-07-01 13:21** *Jourdan*: and added an efficiency column so we can track total return. I think these numbers will need to be played with a bit because efficiency takes a hit if we model it after last years growth
- **2025-07-01 13:21** *Ingrid*: yea def need to adjsut these a lot

- **2025-07-02 14:23** *Jourdan*: Disruptors is Meta’s high level rep program. You get access to new products, have a rep with more leverage to get things done, run hold out test etc. Kinda gave me the vibes we had on the google call. Not sure if we’re in a special program there but i was surprised at the knowledge and access to tools.  You do have to qualify from a spend perspective over a quarter and I can assume Sharma has some brands in the program
- **2025-07-02 14:23** *Jourdan*: I’ve worked with 2 brands in it and it was a good experience. I’ll ask the team in one of our chats
- **2025-07-02 14:25** *Ingrid*: can you ask Sharma to get us into the program?

- **2025-07-03 15:11** *Ingrid*: can you look back on June 2024 Meta to see what rev it delivered?
- **2025-07-03 15:11** *Ingrid*: this number for june 2024 feels off
- **2025-07-03 15:18** *Jourdan*: 319,286.56 is what I’m getting
- **2025-07-03 15:25** *Ingrid*: from Meta in June 2024?

- **2025-07-03 15:26** *Ingrid*: soooo weird
- **2025-07-03 15:27** *Ingrid*: Chris in his tracker has $227k in meta spend
- **2025-07-03 15:27** *Jourdan*: Meta + affiliate?
- **2025-07-03 15:27** *Ingrid*: just meta
- **2025-07-03 15:28** *Ingrid*: ill connect w him on it
- **2025-07-03 15:28** *Ingrid*: thank you
- **2025-07-03 15:30** *Jourdan*: Hmm ok ok it might include other channels since it’s paid social. I can check other channels for that time too
- **2025-07-03 15:32** *Ingrid*: he has it broken out as just meta - it's ok dont spin your wheels on this one
- **2025-07-03 15:32** *Ingrid*: i had a good long chat with Ari about changing all our campaigns to product funnels
- **2025-07-03 15:33** *Ingrid*: she is fully onboard and we can revisit on monday when we all chat
- **2025-07-03 15:34** *Jourdan*: Okay sweet, I followed up with Jake and he echoed that. They’ll kick it off next week he just wanted to align with SB team
- **2025-07-03 15:34** *Ingrid*: perf
- **2025-07-03 15:34** *Ingrid*: thank you! yea - we'll then need to adjust all our reporting and KPIS, yay
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Jourdan*: Didn’t want to kick anything new off over 4th of July weekend. Would be nice to have produce specific goals too 
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Ingrid*: maybe take a stab at a new way to track all that - I'm still going to track the total business like we are doing, but on a daily/weekly we need to have Sharma report differently on pacing and performance
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Ingrid*: ha same minds
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Jourdan*: Yesss lol it’ll make narrowing down to needle movers much easier 
- **2025-07-03 15:36** *Ingrid*: I'm going to work on a doc for how I am thinking about seperating
- **2025-07-03 15:36** *Ingrid*: and then share with you
- **2025-07-03 15:42** *Ingrid*: will also give us a clean way to create a funnel for the full size sauna
- **2025-07-03 15:42** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good! Do we have any sales resources to take phone calls to sell that?
- **2025-07-07 14:50** *Ingrid*: Hey - I may be a few minutes late to the 1pm with Sharma - go ahead without me and I’ll call you after 
- **2025-07-07 14:50** *Ingrid*: Mainly want to make sure we are on track with the reconfiguration of the product funnels 
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good. Google performance looks solid with increase MTD but getting concenred about Meta CAC mtd. L7 looks okay but its ballooned and ill get an update on single product camps
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Ingrid*: I’m just at the dr and he is running late 
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Jourdan*: Okkkk! I hope everything is okay
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Ingrid*: Oh yea just a checkup 
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Jourdan*: Sounds good! Talk to you in a bit
- **2025-07-07 14:52** *Ingrid*: Also gentle reminder to do you performance marketing and DTC summary today
- **2025-07-07 14:52** *Jourdan*: Yesss ma’am saw the update come through (From Elyse) and have my calendar event\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-07 14:52** *Ingrid*: I’ll setup a weekly for us at 11am Mondays to review everything starting next week
- **2025-07-07 15:29** *Jourdan*: Call wrapped just some quick notes until we chat.  
  
• Campaigns shifted to single product by Wed EOD   
    ◦ Killing Legacy Campaigns (Holding Us Back)  
• Using Product Sets vs All Products in Meta Catalogs  
    ◦ Issue popped up w/ a bundle being served on IG that’s not avail on website.   
    ◦ Solution 1: Turn off product in Catalog so it doesn’t serve in Feed  
    ◦ Solution 2: Change in Shopify so there’s no chance of Shopify settings overruling Meta settings and showing the product as avail   
    ◦ Solution 3: Use Custom Product sets in Ads Manager featuring the Core 4. Could help w/ AOV and only serve DPA ads to high quality audiences which could lift performance on catalog campaigns.   
    ◦ I vote for Solution 2 and 3. SB doesn’t have ability to change on their end so this will need to be an internal update.   
• We’ve got a lot creative for PEMF and Sauna Blanket and some for Red Light Mask but could use more and not enough for Hat. Laura agreed to increase briefs for Hat &amp; Mask this week to be ready for Friday’s call. \n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-07 15:32** *Ingrid*: Agree - I like solution 3
- **2025-07-08 00:11** *Jourdan*: Here’s the written weekly report [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?usp=sharing)
- **2025-07-08 00:11** *Jourdan*: Elyse’s doc was updated earlier today
- **2025-07-08 00:12** *Jourdan*: I can include screenshots from Bark AI as those are inline with some of the images the previous GS provided
- **2025-07-08 09:59** *Jourdan*: If we’re not serving YT primarily then we may need to run some exclusions if possible. Not sure how i feel about these ads serving in Gmail and being effective
- **2025-07-08 10:00** *Jourdan*: Reminds me of an audience network placement on meta
- **2025-07-08 10:06** *Ingrid*: yea agree - bring it up on the google call?
- **2025-07-08 10:06** *Ingrid*: def chase jeremy
- **2025-07-08 10:07** *Ingrid*: thanks for staying on top of that - reviewing your summary now!
- **2025-07-08 10:08** *Jourdan*: You’re welcome! I just reached out to him. TT is the bad apple and if we can’t get it right i rather pull spend down and reallocate to AWIN or Google\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-08 10:08** *Jourdan*: AWIN looks juiiiiccyy with 35% increase in spend\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-08 10:25** *Ingrid*: yea we gave that channel the july 4th deal that only existed for affiliates!
- **2025-07-09 11:08** *Ingrid*: this would be compared to MNTN obviously
- **2025-07-09 11:09** *Ingrid*: need to evaluate which is better
- **2025-07-09 11:09** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am we’re on same page\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-09 11:09** *Jourdan*: Would be good to ask creative questions while we have them too\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-09 11:19** *Ingrid*: this is cool bc it's affilaite/sales based
- **2025-07-09 11:19** *Jourdan*: Could run both MNTN and this with them having two different goals
- **2025-07-09 11:20** *Jourdan*: Just curious what kind of offers they run on these channels w/ promos and QRs not being super effecitve
- **2025-07-09 11:21** *Ingrid*: yea, i guess my worry would be running them at the same time would inflate impact on both
- **2025-07-09 11:21** *Jourdan*: Yeah attribution could get muddy here since there’s no last touch
- **2025-07-09 11:22** *Ingrid*: word - let's pick one to start with then add the other
- **2025-07-09 11:22** *Ingrid*: let me know which you think is best to start
- **2025-07-09 11:23** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good. I’m 50/50 because there’s a lot of learnings to leverage from affiliates
- **2025-07-09 11:26** *Ingrid*: let's see what an adequest test budget would be
- **2025-07-09 11:26** *Ingrid*: we know MNTN is like 10-15k
- **2025-07-09 11:27** *Ingrid*: adequate*
- **2025-07-09 11:27** *Ingrid*: ah 15k
- **2025-07-09 11:28** *Jourdan*: Seems like we might get more bang for a buck with the $15k spent
- **2025-07-09 11:28** *Ingrid*: can you send the answers to these questions to her once she sends?
- **2025-07-09 11:29** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am
- **2025-07-09 13:39** *Jourdan*: Hey, just to keep you updated. Talked to Rahul  & Tori about scaling Google and adjusting T ROAS.  
  
We’re going to adjust T ROAS (15% Recommended by Google Rep) first. Continue w/ budget scale test for 30 days which ends 6.19.  
  
However a few campaigns aren’t scaling incrementally so we’ll make a judgement call on 6.19 to reduce spend.
- **2025-07-09 13:41** *Jourdan*: My thoughts… We push Google &amp; AWIN making Google our primary channel for spend while reducing dependency on Meta until we can meet a sub $800 CAC (1d, 1st time) KPI there. Already seeing this happen L30 with Google taking 35% of spend vs 31% on Meta. Ultimately we gotta get Meta more efficient so we don’t stress Google to hard and blow up CAC there’s a balance we need
- **2025-07-09 13:48** *Ingrid*: fully aligned and really appreciate the input and judgement call\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Jourdan*
- **2025-07-10 16:31** *Ingrid*: hey slack me if you need me on the call now
- **2025-07-10 16:31** *Ingrid*: i need to wrap up a few things and have already heard their thing
- **2025-07-10 16:31** *Ingrid*: im here just heads down
- **2025-07-10 16:33** *Jourdan*: Okay yeah no worries
- **2025-07-10 17:07** *Ingrid*: how did it go?
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: Still speaking with her but good so far
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: like the placement options they have
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: DOOH offering is pretty cool too
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: the others didn’t offer
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: Just wrapped
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: Starting recommended budget is a lot higher than the others but they also manage for us
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: $100-150k for 3 months
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: told her to come back with something in the 50-60k for 3 months
- **2025-07-10 17:22** *Jourdan*: They also mentioned canvases that surround the video creative featuring quotes and QR codes
- **2025-07-10 17:23** *Jourdan*: Liked that aspect because gives us the ability to incorporate messaging and give people option to visit website directly but after speaking with TV Scientific doesn’t seem that those are super effective
- **2025-07-10 17:23** *Jourdan*: she mentioned 30s videos as being most successful on their placements so gives a little more time for QR codes but still not that much
- **2025-07-10 17:31** *Ingrid*: ok yea, i def think they are too expensive for us and I'd suggest we start with the other 2
- **2025-07-10 17:31** *Ingrid*: how are our new campaigns doing this week
- **2025-07-10 17:33** *Ingrid*: also, loved your weekly one-pager. can you make one for YTD/H1?
- **2025-07-10 17:33** *Ingrid*: really want your analysis on how the year has been - what's been good, what needs to change, how we prep for H2
- **2025-07-10 17:39** *Ingrid*: i just left a few comments here for you too
- **2025-07-10 17:39** *Ingrid*: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?tab=t.0)\n\n📎 **GS | Weekly Report | 7.7.25** (gdoc, 133.2KB) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?tab=t.0)
- **2025-07-10 17:39** *Jourdan*: Okay yes i can work on the H1 breakdown\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-10 17:43** *Jourdan*: and we’re on day 2 so not a lot of data.  
  
However Red Light Hat is strongest campaign based on in platform data with 2.83 ROAS and $780 AOV  
Red Light Mask has one purchase a .50 ROAS  
PEMF Mat has one conversion at .9 ROAS  
Sauna Blanket has one conversion  at .08 ROAS but low AOV ($70) so i think it tracked a conversion from a different product
- **2025-07-10 17:43** *Jourdan*: $750/day budget across each of those campaigns
- **2025-07-10 17:45** *Jourdan*: I’d give til end of day 3 to assess
- **2025-07-10 17:54** *Ingrid*: ok cool - i LOVE having this level of product data
- **2025-07-10 17:55** *Ingrid*: let's try to move the needle on our YoY growth, down 6% is bad
- **2025-07-10 17:55** *Ingrid*: can you dig in and see where the bleeding is?
- **2025-07-10 18:09** *Jourdan*: Surface level, I’m sure you see this too but CVR is down 52%, AOV down 13%, and Return customer down 10%  although sessions are up 132%. Also seeing discounts higher ($52.7k) this month than last year ($38.7k).  [Discounts](https://admin.shopify.com/store/higherdose/analytics/reports/total*sales*by*product?ql=FROM+sales%0A++SHOW+net*items*sold%2C+gross*sales%2C+discounts%2C+returns%2C+net*sales%2C+taxes%2C%0A++++total*sales%0A++WHERE+product*title+IS+NOT+NULL%0A++GROUP+BY+product*title%2C+product*vendor%2C+product*type+WITH+TOTALS%2C%0A++++PERCENT*CHANGE%0A++SINCE+startOfMonth%280m%29+UNTIL+today%0A++COMPARE+TO+previous*year%0A++ORDER+BY+total*sales+DESC%0A++LIMIT+1000%0AVISUALIZE+total*sales+TYPE+horizontal_bar) doesn’t make sense since we didn’t have 4th of July sale.  
  
Sessions alone could explain CVR since we’re sending more traffic  
  
Sauna Blanket down 32% in Sales Rev but the Kit is up 26% so discrepancy isn’t that large.  
PEMF Pro Mat down 58%  
  
Silver lining, Body Sculptor has 32k in rev which makes up for some of the downtrends from existing products.
- **2025-07-10 18:16** *Jourdan*: How do we correct, push harder on Red Light Hat. Seems to be the most efficient product w/ paid media. This could improve Meta performance and drive more rev. However we need to improve Sauna Blanket and PEMF Mat paid media performance. Could be a creative solution or produce new landing page assets for those products.
- **2025-07-10 18:34** *Ingrid*: Can you please align with Laura for that creative brief due tomorrow
- **2025-07-10 18:34** *Ingrid*: Let’s include everything we need to push these softer comp products 
- **2025-07-10 18:34** *Ingrid*: She said you never go back to her?
- **2025-07-10 18:37** *Jourdan*: Looks like she tagged me in the brief last night (Im CST right now) but I just got back to her with a reply and added in Red Light Hat to her product mix\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-10 18:38** *Jourdan*: From what Jake shared we’ve got more Blanket and PEMF creative than Red Light
- **2025-07-10 18:38** *Jourdan*: however with sales being down we still need resources here to improve efficiency
- **2025-07-10 18:39** *Jourdan* 💬 10 replies: Do we want to focus on the Red Light Neck Enhancer?
- **2025-07-10 19:02** *Jourdan*: What products should we focus on for CTV? I know Core 4 for sure but are there any others we should include?
- **2025-07-10 19:03** *Jourdan*: Laura brought up Full Spectrum Sauna and mentioned Lauren has interest mixing topicals into our efforts  :eyes:
- **2025-07-10 20:12** *Ingrid*: I’d start with lifestyle and core 4 to start, it’s a good intro to the brand 
- **2025-07-10 20:12** *Ingrid*: Then we can add full size and topicals once we prove out the channel on the basics 
- **2025-07-10 20:13** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good
- **2025-07-10 20:13** *Jourdan*: thank you
- **2025-07-10 20:17** *Jourdan*: Okay any interest in Endorphin oil + sweat band, trans mag spray, and press?  
  
These are lower AOV so i assume keeping it to Red Light, PEMF, and SB to get us back on track would be ideal?
- **2025-07-11 17:06** *Ingrid*: Appreciate you being on top of sharma on those campaigns!
- **2025-07-11 17:10** *Jourdan*: Of course! I want to get this thing turned around asap. Meta can be a lot better which will lift the entire ecosystem and make rev targets at efficiency a bit easier. Seeing these segmented by product is so valuable! Thank you for being behind that push as well\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-11 17:23** *Ingrid*: Yes getting meta right will do soooo much 
- **2025-07-11 17:23** *Ingrid*: Go team 
- **2025-07-14 13:03** *Ingrid*: 2 min!

- **2025-07-14 13:39** *Jourdan*: Last question, are we looking at gross sales or net when looking at YOY?
- **2025-07-14 13:39** *Ingrid*: Net as it’s in Shopify 
- **2025-07-14 13:39** *Ingrid*: Sales after returns and discounts 
- **2025-07-14 13:43** *Jourdan*: Okay net is showing down 3%. It does look like we’ve got a good bit less of discount rev this year compared to last year but returns are up a lot.  
  
I’d expect net to be up YoY but returns make up the money saved with less discount rev.\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-07-14 at 13.38.39.png** (png, 136.7KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F095T0L78TE/screenshot_2025-07-14_at_13.38.39.png)
- **2025-07-14 13:44** *Ingrid*: It’s all solvable with more top line sales

- **2025-07-15 10:48** *Jourdan*: Hey @Ingrid My mom fell this morning and opened her incision so I’ve been on the phone with her ortho’s office figuring out what to do. I’m sorry for the late heads up I’m just a little overwhelmed 
- **2025-07-15 11:14** *Ingrid*: Oh, man I really hope she is ok and I'm glad you're there to help her. Thanks so much for the heads up, I was super concerned!
- **2025-07-15 11:22** *Jourdan*: I think she will be just in a lot of pain. Thankfully her ortho reassured me and we’ll be able to get her to urgent care today so they can close it back up since it was glued. I’ll follow up with Sharma i see they reached out to lock in CAC
- **2025-07-15 11:59** *Ingrid*: ok, glad there is a plan to get her to a better place

- **2025-07-17 11:40** *Jourdan*: Yes i was but stepped away to the bathroom so missed that question. Here’s my notes from the convo

“What percentage of your revenue comes from D2C, retail, and marketplace”  
  
W/ 36M on Shopify last 12 months I’m assuming retail and marketplace accounts are tracked off platform?  
Is it safe to say those 2 make up 20% of the total rev?\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-17 13:39** *Ingrid*: yes, 85% DTC
- **2025-07-17 13:39** *Ingrid*: rest retail/marketplace

- **2025-06-24 15:33** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good
- **2025-06-24 15:51** *Ingrid*: This will go up against YouTube in my mind 
- **2025-06-24 15:51** *Ingrid*: So we should test both ahead of holiday 
- **2025-06-24 15:52** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good. Are we close to launching Youtube? I remember mentions from one of the calls this week but not a timeline
- **2025-06-24 15:53** *Ingrid*: Yes! It’s in creative optimization as we speak 
- **2025-06-24 15:53** *Ingrid*: Should be ready to test in July - we can dig deeper soon

- **2025-06-24 16:08** *Ingrid*: I’ll setup time for us so we can chat through budgeting for the rest of the year and see how we can fit in a test here
- **2025-06-24 16:23** *Jourdan*: Okay thank you
- **2025-06-24 16:23** *Jourdan*: how do i see amazon performance? I don’t see it as a line item in North Beam
- **2025-06-25 11:11** *Ingrid*: let's go through Amazon stuff together when we chat tomororw
- **2025-06-25 11:12** *Ingrid*: I also want to make sure you're able to join that Decile call today at 1pm, would love you to own that data and relationship, I think it's powerful and I never had the time to unlock it properly
- **2025-06-25 11:12** *Ingrid*: sorry at 10am
- **2025-06-25 11:12** *Ingrid*: our time

- **2025-06-25 13:03** *Ingrid*: word, i knew you would like it
- **2025-06-25 13:03** *Jourdan*: Decile had a lot of interesting insights around customer data. Perfect tool to use for figuring out Paid Hero products and which lead to higher LTV
- **2025-06-25 13:03** *Jourdan*: The highdration kit was not on my radar at all
- **2025-06-25 13:03** *Ingrid*: yes! ok yea def dig into how we operationalize the decile data
- **2025-06-25 13:04** *Ingrid*: the highdraytion powder is gross imo
- **2025-06-25 13:04** *Ingrid*: we need a new formulation lol
- **2025-06-25 13:05** *Jourdan*: I think most have been given away for free at this point.  22% customer share ratio and and crazy 1st time rev so i feel like people we’re buying other products and this was a free gift + purchase item\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-25 at 11.04.43.png** (png, 190.7KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F093FM9AAKB/screenshot_2025-06-25_at_11.04.43.png)

- **2025-06-30 11:21** *Ingrid*: cool no prob
- **2025-06-30 11:39** *Jourdan*: So iffy on pinterest platform reporting but thats based in bias on previous experiences. Im open to exploring here just need reporting based on in platform 1 day attribution to make decisions

- **2025-06-30 17:39** *Jourdan*: working on individual months now
- **2025-06-30 17:42** *Jourdan*: Is the 1.6 m on $350k in spend is for all paid channels and is that Shopify Rev only?
- **2025-06-30 17:43** *Jourdan*: Basically should i update sales goal on july tab to 1.6 m because i see spend is at $350k
- **2025-06-30 20:49** *Ingrid*: Well let’s discuss it and align to a reasonable but but stretch goal to get everyone focused 
- **2025-06-30 20:50** *Ingrid*: I’ll review the doc tomorrow and then we can catch about H2 budgets and goals to make sure we are tracking to where we need to be on both spend and sales 
- **2025-06-30 20:52** *Jourdan*: Okay awesome I’ll work on individual months so we have some starting projections to work with

- **2025-07-01 11:45** *Jourdan*: I see its been completed, I’ll keep this same format for next week. I changed it last week and there’s a handful of new metrics that people may not be familiar with
- **2025-07-01 11:56** *Ingrid*: ok great - can you do one that is H1 now that it's over?
- **2025-07-01 11:57** *Jourdan*: So DTC performance recap from Jan to June right?
- **2025-07-01 12:00** *Ingrid*: Yes please 
- **2025-07-01 13:17** *Jourdan*: Updated Summaries with projections
- **2025-07-01 13:17** *Jourdan*: Used previous years growth and applied to sales and spend to get 2025 projections
- **2025-07-01 13:18** *Jourdan*: I left a formula key but if it doesn’t make sense let me know
- **2025-07-01 13:18** *Jourdan*: I could also project based on avg growth since 2023
- **2025-07-01 13:19** *Jourdan*: Also updated the YTD table to give data up until the quarter we’re viewing. So Q3 doesn’t include Q4  and Q2 doesn’t include Q3
- **2025-07-01 13:21** *Jourdan*: and added an efficiency column so we can track total return. I think these numbers will need to be played with a bit because efficiency takes a hit if we model it after last years growth
- **2025-07-01 13:21** *Ingrid*: yea def need to adjsut these a lot
- **2025-07-01 13:22** *Ingrid*: the goal I have for total 2025 is 20% Growth	22%	5%	$8,307,513	$37,083,320

- **2025-07-01 13:23** *Ingrid*: with the highlighted being the key goal
- **2025-07-01 13:24** *Ingrid*: the previous years data is all over the place so not the best guideline
- **2025-07-01 13:24** *Jourdan*: Okay cool cool adjusting now
- **2025-07-01 13:24** *Ingrid*: thank you!
- **2025-07-01 13:24** *Jourdan*: You’re welcome
- **2025-07-01 19:57** *Jourdan*: Made those updates. Spend in Q1 Summary didn’t reflect Affiliate spend so i updated that. If you check Q4 summary the totals are inline with your projections
- **2025-07-01 19:57** *Jourdan*: We just have to get super efficient the remainder of the year
- **2025-07-01 20:00** *Jourdan*: Moving to EOM and H1 reports 
- **2025-07-02 14:05** *Jourdan*: Are you familiar with the disruptors program at Meta?
- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Ingrid*: hi! im not - but tell me about it!
- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Ingrid*: also - i need to skip the call with Bark, which is fine bc it's. good for you to meet them anyway and have them walk you through the platform
- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Ingrid*: i need to do amazon stuff with chris
- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Jourdan*: Okay no worries! I’ll get up to speed with them\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-02 14:23** *Jourdan*: Disruptors is Meta’s high level rep program. You get access to new products, have a rep with more leverage to get things done, run hold out test etc. Kinda gave me the vibes we had on the google call. Not sure if we’re in a special program there but i was surprised at the knowledge and access to tools.  You do have to qualify from a spend perspective over a quarter and I can assume Sharma has some brands in the program
- **2025-07-02 14:23** *Jourdan*: I’ve worked with 2 brands in it and it was a good experience. I’ll ask the team in one of our chats
- **2025-07-02 14:25** *Ingrid*: can you ask Sharma to get us into the program?
- **2025-07-02 14:27** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am for sure
- **2025-07-02 15:26** *Ingrid*: hey let me know when you're off with Bark
- **2025-07-02 15:26** *Ingrid*: I have more questions about these spreadsheet inputs
- **2025-07-02 15:27** *Jourdan*: I’m off call with them. Pretty useful platform to help navigate which products to put more creative and paid resources behind based on profit per view

- **2025-07-03 15:11** *Ingrid*: can you look back on June 2024 Meta to see what rev it delivered?
- **2025-07-03 15:11** *Ingrid*: this number for june 2024 feels off
- **2025-07-03 15:18** *Jourdan*: 319,286.56 is what I’m getting
- **2025-07-03 15:25** *Ingrid*: from Meta in June 2024?

- **2025-07-03 15:26** *Ingrid*: soooo weird
- **2025-07-03 15:27** *Ingrid*: Chris in his tracker has $227k in meta spend
- **2025-07-03 15:27** *Jourdan*: Meta + affiliate?
- **2025-07-03 15:27** *Ingrid*: just meta
- **2025-07-03 15:28** *Ingrid*: ill connect w him on it
- **2025-07-03 15:28** *Ingrid*: thank you
- **2025-07-03 15:30** *Jourdan*: Hmm ok ok it might include other channels since it’s paid social. I can check other channels for that time too
- **2025-07-03 15:32** *Ingrid*: he has it broken out as just meta - it's ok dont spin your wheels on this one
- **2025-07-03 15:32** *Ingrid*: i had a good long chat with Ari about changing all our campaigns to product funnels
- **2025-07-03 15:33** *Ingrid*: she is fully onboard and we can revisit on monday when we all chat
- **2025-07-03 15:34** *Jourdan*: Okay sweet, I followed up with Jake and he echoed that. They’ll kick it off next week he just wanted to align with SB team
- **2025-07-03 15:34** *Ingrid*: perf
- **2025-07-03 15:34** *Ingrid*: thank you! yea - we'll then need to adjust all our reporting and KPIS, yay
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Jourdan*: Didn’t want to kick anything new off over 4th of July weekend. Would be nice to have produce specific goals too 
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Ingrid*: maybe take a stab at a new way to track all that - I'm still going to track the total business like we are doing, but on a daily/weekly we need to have Sharma report differently on pacing and performance
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Ingrid*: ha same minds
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Jourdan*: Yesss lol it’ll make narrowing down to needle movers much easier 
- **2025-07-03 15:36** *Ingrid*: I'm going to work on a doc for how I am thinking about seperating
- **2025-07-03 15:36** *Ingrid*: and then share with you
- **2025-07-03 15:42** *Ingrid*: will also give us a clean way to create a funnel for the full size sauna
- **2025-07-03 15:42** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good! Do we have any sales resources to take phone calls to sell that?
- **2025-07-07 14:50** *Ingrid*: Hey - I may be a few minutes late to the 1pm with Sharma - go ahead without me and I’ll call you after 
- **2025-07-07 14:50** *Ingrid*: Mainly want to make sure we are on track with the reconfiguration of the product funnels 
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good. Google performance looks solid with increase MTD but getting concenred about Meta CAC mtd. L7 looks okay but its ballooned and ill get an update on single product camps
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Ingrid*: I’m just at the dr and he is running late 
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Jourdan*: Okkkk! I hope everything is okay
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Ingrid*: Oh yea just a checkup 
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Jourdan*: Sounds good! Talk to you in a bit
- **2025-07-07 14:52** *Ingrid*: Also gentle reminder to do you performance marketing and DTC summary today
- **2025-07-07 14:52** *Jourdan*: Yesss ma’am saw the update come through (From Elyse) and have my calendar event\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-07 14:52** *Ingrid*: I’ll setup a weekly for us at 11am Mondays to review everything starting next week
- **2025-07-07 15:29** *Jourdan*: Call wrapped just some quick notes until we chat.  
  
• Campaigns shifted to single product by Wed EOD   
    ◦ Killing Legacy Campaigns (Holding Us Back)  
• Using Product Sets vs All Products in Meta Catalogs  
    ◦ Issue popped up w/ a bundle being served on IG that’s not avail on website.   
    ◦ Solution 1: Turn off product in Catalog so it doesn’t serve in Feed  
    ◦ Solution 2: Change in Shopify so there’s no chance of Shopify settings overruling Meta settings and showing the product as avail   
    ◦ Solution 3: Use Custom Product sets in Ads Manager featuring the Core 4. Could help w/ AOV and only serve DPA ads to high quality audiences which could lift performance on catalog campaigns.   
    ◦ I vote for Solution 2 and 3. SB doesn’t have ability to change on their end so this will need to be an internal update.   
• We’ve got a lot creative for PEMF and Sauna Blanket and some for Red Light Mask but could use more and not enough for Hat. Laura agreed to increase briefs for Hat &amp; Mask this week to be ready for Friday’s call. \n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-07 15:32** *Ingrid*: Agree - I like solution 3
- **2025-07-08 00:11** *Jourdan*: Here’s the written weekly report [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?usp=sharing)
- **2025-07-08 00:11** *Jourdan*: Elyse’s doc was updated earlier today
- **2025-07-08 00:12** *Jourdan*: I can include screenshots from Bark AI as those are inline with some of the images the previous GS provided
- **2025-07-08 09:59** *Jourdan*: If we’re not serving YT primarily then we may need to run some exclusions if possible. Not sure how i feel about these ads serving in Gmail and being effective
- **2025-07-08 10:00** *Jourdan*: Reminds me of an audience network placement on meta
- **2025-07-08 10:06** *Ingrid*: yea agree - bring it up on the google call?
- **2025-07-08 10:06** *Ingrid*: def chase jeremy
- **2025-07-08 10:07** *Ingrid*: thanks for staying on top of that - reviewing your summary now!
- **2025-07-08 10:08** *Jourdan*: You’re welcome! I just reached out to him. TT is the bad apple and if we can’t get it right i rather pull spend down and reallocate to AWIN or Google\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-08 10:08** *Jourdan*: AWIN looks juiiiiccyy with 35% increase in spend\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-08 10:25** *Ingrid*: yea we gave that channel the july 4th deal that only existed for affiliates!
- **2025-07-09 11:08** *Ingrid*: this would be compared to MNTN obviously
- **2025-07-09 11:09** *Ingrid*: need to evaluate which is better
- **2025-07-09 11:09** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am we’re on same page\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-09 11:09** *Jourdan*: Would be good to ask creative questions while we have them too\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-09 11:19** *Ingrid*: this is cool bc it's affilaite/sales based
- **2025-07-09 11:19** *Jourdan*: Could run both MNTN and this with them having two different goals
- **2025-07-09 11:20** *Jourdan*: Just curious what kind of offers they run on these channels w/ promos and QRs not being super effecitve
- **2025-07-09 11:21** *Ingrid*: yea, i guess my worry would be running them at the same time would inflate impact on both
- **2025-07-09 11:21** *Jourdan*: Yeah attribution could get muddy here since there’s no last touch
- **2025-07-09 11:22** *Ingrid*: word - let's pick one to start with then add the other
- **2025-07-09 11:22** *Ingrid*: let me know which you think is best to start
- **2025-07-09 11:23** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good. I’m 50/50 because there’s a lot of learnings to leverage from affiliates
- **2025-07-09 11:26** *Ingrid*: let's see what an adequest test budget would be
- **2025-07-09 11:26** *Ingrid*: we know MNTN is like 10-15k
- **2025-07-09 11:27** *Ingrid*: adequate*
- **2025-07-09 11:27** *Ingrid*: ah 15k
- **2025-07-09 11:28** *Jourdan*: Seems like we might get more bang for a buck with the $15k spent
- **2025-07-09 11:28** *Ingrid*: can you send the answers to these questions to her once she sends?
- **2025-07-09 11:29** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am
- **2025-07-09 13:39** *Jourdan*: Hey, just to keep you updated. Talked to Rahul  & Tori about scaling Google and adjusting T ROAS.  
  
We’re going to adjust T ROAS (15% Recommended by Google Rep) first. Continue w/ budget scale test for 30 days which ends 6.19.  
  
However a few campaigns aren’t scaling incrementally so we’ll make a judgement call on 6.19 to reduce spend.
- **2025-07-09 13:41** *Jourdan*: My thoughts… We push Google &amp; AWIN making Google our primary channel for spend while reducing dependency on Meta until we can meet a sub $800 CAC (1d, 1st time) KPI there. Already seeing this happen L30 with Google taking 35% of spend vs 31% on Meta. Ultimately we gotta get Meta more efficient so we don’t stress Google to hard and blow up CAC there’s a balance we need
- **2025-07-09 13:48** *Ingrid*: fully aligned and really appreciate the input and judgement call\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Jourdan*
- **2025-07-10 16:31** *Ingrid*: hey slack me if you need me on the call now
- **2025-07-10 16:31** *Ingrid*: i need to wrap up a few things and have already heard their thing
- **2025-07-10 16:31** *Ingrid*: im here just heads down
- **2025-07-10 16:33** *Jourdan*: Okay yeah no worries
- **2025-07-10 17:07** *Ingrid*: how did it go?
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: Still speaking with her but good so far
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: like the placement options they have
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: DOOH offering is pretty cool too
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: the others didn’t offer
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: Just wrapped
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: Starting recommended budget is a lot higher than the others but they also manage for us
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: $100-150k for 3 months
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: told her to come back with something in the 50-60k for 3 months
- **2025-07-10 17:22** *Jourdan*: They also mentioned canvases that surround the video creative featuring quotes and QR codes
- **2025-07-10 17:23** *Jourdan*: Liked that aspect because gives us the ability to incorporate messaging and give people option to visit website directly but after speaking with TV Scientific doesn’t seem that those are super effective
- **2025-07-10 17:23** *Jourdan*: she mentioned 30s videos as being most successful on their placements so gives a little more time for QR codes but still not that much
- **2025-07-10 17:31** *Ingrid*: ok yea, i def think they are too expensive for us and I'd suggest we start with the other 2
- **2025-07-10 17:31** *Ingrid*: how are our new campaigns doing this week
- **2025-07-10 17:33** *Ingrid*: also, loved your weekly one-pager. can you make one for YTD/H1?
- **2025-07-10 17:33** *Ingrid*: really want your analysis on how the year has been - what's been good, what needs to change, how we prep for H2
- **2025-07-10 17:39** *Ingrid*: i just left a few comments here for you too
- **2025-07-10 17:39** *Ingrid*: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?tab=t.0)\n\n📎 **GS | Weekly Report | 7.7.25** (gdoc, 133.2KB) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?tab=t.0)
- **2025-07-10 17:39** *Jourdan*: Okay yes i can work on the H1 breakdown\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-10 17:43** *Jourdan*: and we’re on day 2 so not a lot of data.  
  
However Red Light Hat is strongest campaign based on in platform data with 2.83 ROAS and $780 AOV  
Red Light Mask has one purchase a .50 ROAS  
PEMF Mat has one conversion at .9 ROAS  
Sauna Blanket has one conversion  at .08 ROAS but low AOV ($70) so i think it tracked a conversion from a different product
- **2025-07-10 17:43** *Jourdan*: $750/day budget across each of those campaigns
- **2025-07-10 17:45** *Jourdan*: I’d give til end of day 3 to assess
- **2025-07-10 17:54** *Ingrid*: ok cool - i LOVE having this level of product data
- **2025-07-10 17:55** *Ingrid*: let's try to move the needle on our YoY growth, down 6% is bad
- **2025-07-10 17:55** *Ingrid*: can you dig in and see where the bleeding is?
- **2025-07-10 18:09** *Jourdan*: Surface level, I’m sure you see this too but CVR is down 52%, AOV down 13%, and Return customer down 10%  although sessions are up 132%. Also seeing discounts higher ($52.7k) this month than last year ($38.7k).  [Discounts](https://admin.shopify.com/store/higherdose/analytics/reports/total*sales*by*product?ql=FROM+sales%0A++SHOW+net*items*sold%2C+gross*sales%2C+discounts%2C+returns%2C+net*sales%2C+taxes%2C%0A++++total*sales%0A++WHERE+product*title+IS+NOT+NULL%0A++GROUP+BY+product*title%2C+product*vendor%2C+product*type+WITH+TOTALS%2C%0A++++PERCENT*CHANGE%0A++SINCE+startOfMonth%280m%29+UNTIL+today%0A++COMPARE+TO+previous*year%0A++ORDER+BY+total*sales+DESC%0A++LIMIT+1000%0AVISUALIZE+total*sales+TYPE+horizontal_bar) doesn’t make sense since we didn’t have 4th of July sale.  
  
Sessions alone could explain CVR since we’re sending more traffic  
  
Sauna Blanket down 32% in Sales Rev but the Kit is up 26% so discrepancy isn’t that large.  
PEMF Pro Mat down 58%  
  
Silver lining, Body Sculptor has 32k in rev which makes up for some of the downtrends from existing products.
- **2025-07-10 18:16** *Jourdan*: How do we correct, push harder on Red Light Hat. Seems to be the most efficient product w/ paid media. This could improve Meta performance and drive more rev. However we need to improve Sauna Blanket and PEMF Mat paid media performance. Could be a creative solution or produce new landing page assets for those products.
- **2025-07-10 18:34** *Ingrid*: Can you please align with Laura for that creative brief due tomorrow
- **2025-07-10 18:34** *Ingrid*: Let’s include everything we need to push these softer comp products 
- **2025-07-10 18:34** *Ingrid*: She said you never go back to her?
- **2025-07-10 18:37** *Jourdan*: Looks like she tagged me in the brief last night (Im CST right now) but I just got back to her with a reply and added in Red Light Hat to her product mix\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-10 18:38** *Jourdan*: From what Jake shared we’ve got more Blanket and PEMF creative than Red Light
- **2025-07-10 18:38** *Jourdan*: however with sales being down we still need resources here to improve efficiency
- **2025-07-10 18:39** *Jourdan* 💬 10 replies: Do we want to focus on the Red Light Neck Enhancer?
- **2025-07-10 19:02** *Jourdan*: What products should we focus on for CTV? I know Core 4 for sure but are there any others we should include?
- **2025-07-10 19:03** *Jourdan*: Laura brought up Full Spectrum Sauna and mentioned Lauren has interest mixing topicals into our efforts  :eyes:
- **2025-07-10 20:12** *Ingrid*: I’d start with lifestyle and core 4 to start, it’s a good intro to the brand 
- **2025-07-10 20:12** *Ingrid*: Then we can add full size and topicals once we prove out the channel on the basics 
- **2025-07-10 20:13** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good
- **2025-07-10 20:13** *Jourdan*: thank you
- **2025-07-10 20:17** *Jourdan*: Okay any interest in Endorphin oil + sweat band, trans mag spray, and press?  
  
These are lower AOV so i assume keeping it to Red Light, PEMF, and SB to get us back on track would be ideal?
- **2025-07-11 17:06** *Ingrid*: Appreciate you being on top of sharma on those campaigns!
- **2025-07-11 17:10** *Jourdan*: Of course! I want to get this thing turned around asap. Meta can be a lot better which will lift the entire ecosystem and make rev targets at efficiency a bit easier. Seeing these segmented by product is so valuable! Thank you for being behind that push as well\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-11 17:23** *Ingrid*: Yes getting meta right will do soooo much 
- **2025-07-11 17:23** *Ingrid*: Go team 
- **2025-07-14 13:03** *Ingrid*: 2 min!
- **2025-07-14 13:06** *Ingrid*: here!
- **2025-07-14 13:06** *Jourdan*: had to run to bathroom
- **2025-07-14 13:06** *Jourdan*: be there in a sec
- **2025-07-14 13:07** *Jourdan*: @Ingrid
- **2025-07-14 13:07** *Ingrid*: ok cool

- **2025-07-14 13:39** *Jourdan*: Last question, are we looking at gross sales or net when looking at YOY?
- **2025-07-14 13:39** *Ingrid*: Net as it’s in Shopify 
- **2025-07-14 13:39** *Ingrid*: Sales after returns and discounts 
- **2025-07-14 13:43** *Jourdan*: Okay net is showing down 3%. It does look like we’ve got a good bit less of discount rev this year compared to last year but returns are up a lot.  
  
I’d expect net to be up YoY but returns make up the money saved with less discount rev.\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-07-14 at 13.38.39.png** (png, 136.7KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F095T0L78TE/screenshot_2025-07-14_at_13.38.39.png)
- **2025-07-14 13:44** *Ingrid*: It’s all solvable with more top line sales
- **2025-07-14 13:44** *Ingrid*: We need more cushion there 
- **2025-07-14 13:45** *Jourdan*: Yeah agreed
- **2025-07-14 13:46** *Jourdan*: we’ve got like a 4 day buffer before Google recommends we bump budgets again. Speaking with Anastasia now on increasing\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-14 13:48** *Ingrid*: Ok cool. I’m going to skip the 1pm sharma call but I’d like you to join and tell them what we jsut discussed (the sales gap, the wanting new top of funnel drivers) and let me know what they say. I’ll be on the tomorrow morning call though of course

- **2025-07-15 09:34** *Ingrid*: hey jourdan are you joining this sharma call?
- **2025-07-15 10:48** *Jourdan*: Hey @Ingrid My mom fell this morning and opened her incision so I’ve been on the phone with her ortho’s office figuring out what to do. I’m sorry for the late heads up I’m just a little overwhelmed 
- **2025-07-15 11:14** *Ingrid*: Oh, man I really hope she is ok and I'm glad you're there to help her. Thanks so much for the heads up, I was super concerned!
- **2025-07-15 11:22** *Jourdan*: I think she will be just in a lot of pain. Thankfully her ortho reassured me and we’ll be able to get her to urgent care today so they can close it back up since it was glued. I’ll follow up with Sharma i see they reached out to lock in CAC
- **2025-07-15 11:59** *Ingrid*: ok, glad there is a plan to get her to a better place
- **2025-07-16 13:33** *Jourdan*: Hey I got back to your email and followed up with meta team but they’re in Tel Aviv.   
  
Your mornings next week are a little full but checking to see if you have flexibility for anything morning cst/est after Mon &amp; Tue?
- **2025-07-16 13:57** *Ingrid*: Ah, I'm actually out Mon/Tues next week but I think you and Sharma to should meet them anyway (without me)
- **2025-07-16 13:57** *Ingrid*: so go ahead and book what works for everyone else
- **2025-07-16 14:01** *Jourdan*: Okay I saw you were OOO so sent times that worked with with your schedule but seems like mornings are best for everyone so I’ll follow up with them. \n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*

- **2025-07-16 14:03** *Ingrid*: the bark or meta call?

- **2025-07-17 11:40** *Jourdan*: Yes i was but stepped away to the bathroom so missed that question. Here’s my notes from the convo

“What percentage of your revenue comes from D2C, retail, and marketplace”  
  
W/ 36M on Shopify last 12 months I’m assuming retail and marketplace accounts are tracked off platform?  
Is it safe to say those 2 make up 20% of the total rev?\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-17 13:39** *Ingrid*: yes, 85% DTC
- **2025-07-17 13:39** *Ingrid*: rest retail/marketplace

- **2025-06-24 15:33** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good
- **2025-06-24 15:51** *Ingrid*: This will go up against YouTube in my mind 
- **2025-06-24 15:51** *Ingrid*: So we should test both ahead of holiday 
- **2025-06-24 15:52** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good. Are we close to launching Youtube? I remember mentions from one of the calls this week but not a timeline
- **2025-06-24 15:53** *Ingrid*: Yes! It’s in creative optimization as we speak 
- **2025-06-24 15:53** *Ingrid*: Should be ready to test in July - we can dig deeper soon

- **2025-06-24 16:02** *Ingrid*: That’s cool 
- **2025-06-24 16:02** *Ingrid*: The high intent audience 
- **2025-06-24 16:03** *Jourdan*: Yeah definitely this is data meta used to show us
- **2025-06-24 16:08** *Ingrid*: I’ll setup time for us so we can chat through budgeting for the rest of the year and see how we can fit in a test here
- **2025-06-24 16:23** *Jourdan*: Okay thank you
- **2025-06-24 16:23** *Jourdan*: how do i see amazon performance? I don’t see it as a line item in North Beam
- **2025-06-25 11:11** *Ingrid*: let's go through Amazon stuff together when we chat tomororw
- **2025-06-25 11:12** *Ingrid*: I also want to make sure you're able to join that Decile call today at 1pm, would love you to own that data and relationship, I think it's powerful and I never had the time to unlock it properly
- **2025-06-25 11:12** *Ingrid*: sorry at 10am
- **2025-06-25 11:12** *Ingrid*: our time

- **2025-06-25 13:03** *Ingrid*: word, i knew you would like it
- **2025-06-25 13:03** *Jourdan*: Decile had a lot of interesting insights around customer data. Perfect tool to use for figuring out Paid Hero products and which lead to higher LTV
- **2025-06-25 13:03** *Jourdan*: The highdration kit was not on my radar at all
- **2025-06-25 13:03** *Ingrid*: yes! ok yea def dig into how we operationalize the decile data
- **2025-06-25 13:04** *Ingrid*: the highdraytion powder is gross imo
- **2025-06-25 13:04** *Ingrid*: we need a new formulation lol
- **2025-06-25 13:05** *Jourdan*: I think most have been given away for free at this point.  22% customer share ratio and and crazy 1st time rev so i feel like people we’re buying other products and this was a free gift + purchase item\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-25 at 11.04.43.png** (png, 190.7KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F093FM9AAKB/screenshot_2025-06-25_at_11.04.43.png)

- **2025-06-30 11:21** *Ingrid*: cool no prob
- **2025-06-30 11:39** *Jourdan*: So iffy on pinterest platform reporting but thats based in bias on previous experiences. Im open to exploring here just need reporting based on in platform 1 day attribution to make decisions

- **2025-06-30 17:39** *Jourdan*: working on individual months now
- **2025-06-30 17:42** *Jourdan*: Is the 1.6 m on $350k in spend is for all paid channels and is that Shopify Rev only?
- **2025-06-30 17:43** *Jourdan*: Basically should i update sales goal on july tab to 1.6 m because i see spend is at $350k
- **2025-06-30 20:49** *Ingrid*: Well let’s discuss it and align to a reasonable but but stretch goal to get everyone focused 
- **2025-06-30 20:50** *Ingrid*: I’ll review the doc tomorrow and then we can catch about H2 budgets and goals to make sure we are tracking to where we need to be on both spend and sales 
- **2025-06-30 20:52** *Jourdan*: Okay awesome I’ll work on individual months so we have some starting projections to work with

- **2025-07-01 11:45** *Jourdan*: I see its been completed, I’ll keep this same format for next week. I changed it last week and there’s a handful of new metrics that people may not be familiar with
- **2025-07-01 11:56** *Ingrid*: ok great - can you do one that is H1 now that it's over?
- **2025-07-01 11:57** *Jourdan*: So DTC performance recap from Jan to June right?
- **2025-07-01 12:00** *Ingrid*: Yes please 
- **2025-07-01 13:17** *Jourdan*: Updated Summaries with projections
- **2025-07-01 13:17** *Jourdan*: Used previous years growth and applied to sales and spend to get 2025 projections
- **2025-07-01 13:18** *Jourdan*: I left a formula key but if it doesn’t make sense let me know
- **2025-07-01 13:18** *Jourdan*: I could also project based on avg growth since 2023
- **2025-07-01 13:19** *Jourdan*: Also updated the YTD table to give data up until the quarter we’re viewing. So Q3 doesn’t include Q4  and Q2 doesn’t include Q3
- **2025-07-01 13:21** *Jourdan*: and added an efficiency column so we can track total return. I think these numbers will need to be played with a bit because efficiency takes a hit if we model it after last years growth
- **2025-07-01 13:21** *Ingrid*: yea def need to adjsut these a lot
- **2025-07-01 13:22** *Ingrid*: the goal I have for total 2025 is 20% Growth	22%	5%	$8,307,513	$37,083,320

- **2025-07-01 13:23** *Ingrid*: with the highlighted being the key goal
- **2025-07-01 13:24** *Ingrid*: the previous years data is all over the place so not the best guideline
- **2025-07-01 13:24** *Jourdan*: Okay cool cool adjusting now
- **2025-07-01 13:24** *Ingrid*: thank you!
- **2025-07-01 13:24** *Jourdan*: You’re welcome
- **2025-07-01 19:57** *Jourdan*: Made those updates. Spend in Q1 Summary didn’t reflect Affiliate spend so i updated that. If you check Q4 summary the totals are inline with your projections
- **2025-07-01 19:57** *Jourdan*: We just have to get super efficient the remainder of the year
- **2025-07-01 20:00** *Jourdan*: Moving to EOM and H1 reports 
- **2025-07-02 14:05** *Jourdan*: Are you familiar with the disruptors program at Meta?
- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Ingrid*: hi! im not - but tell me about it!
- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Ingrid*: also - i need to skip the call with Bark, which is fine bc it's. good for you to meet them anyway and have them walk you through the platform
- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Ingrid*: i need to do amazon stuff with chris
- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Jourdan*: Okay no worries! I’ll get up to speed with them\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-02 14:23** *Jourdan*: Disruptors is Meta’s high level rep program. You get access to new products, have a rep with more leverage to get things done, run hold out test etc. Kinda gave me the vibes we had on the google call. Not sure if we’re in a special program there but i was surprised at the knowledge and access to tools.  You do have to qualify from a spend perspective over a quarter and I can assume Sharma has some brands in the program
- **2025-07-02 14:23** *Jourdan*: I’ve worked with 2 brands in it and it was a good experience. I’ll ask the team in one of our chats
- **2025-07-02 14:25** *Ingrid*: can you ask Sharma to get us into the program?
- **2025-07-02 14:27** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am for sure
- **2025-07-02 15:26** *Ingrid*: hey let me know when you're off with Bark

- **2025-07-03 15:11** *Ingrid*: can you look back on June 2024 Meta to see what rev it delivered?
- **2025-07-03 15:11** *Ingrid*: this number for june 2024 feels off
- **2025-07-03 15:18** *Jourdan*: 319,286.56 is what I’m getting
- **2025-07-03 15:25** *Ingrid*: from Meta in June 2024?
- **2025-07-03 15:25** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am

- **2025-07-03 15:26** *Ingrid*: soooo weird
- **2025-07-03 15:27** *Ingrid*: Chris in his tracker has $227k in meta spend
- **2025-07-03 15:27** *Jourdan*: Meta + affiliate?
- **2025-07-03 15:27** *Ingrid*: just meta
- **2025-07-03 15:28** *Ingrid*: ill connect w him on it
- **2025-07-03 15:28** *Ingrid*: thank you
- **2025-07-03 15:30** *Jourdan*: Hmm ok ok it might include other channels since it’s paid social. I can check other channels for that time too
- **2025-07-03 15:32** *Ingrid*: he has it broken out as just meta - it's ok dont spin your wheels on this one
- **2025-07-03 15:32** *Ingrid*: i had a good long chat with Ari about changing all our campaigns to product funnels
- **2025-07-03 15:33** *Ingrid*: she is fully onboard and we can revisit on monday when we all chat
- **2025-07-03 15:34** *Jourdan*: Okay sweet, I followed up with Jake and he echoed that. They’ll kick it off next week he just wanted to align with SB team
- **2025-07-03 15:34** *Ingrid*: perf
- **2025-07-03 15:34** *Ingrid*: thank you! yea - we'll then need to adjust all our reporting and KPIS, yay
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Jourdan*: Didn’t want to kick anything new off over 4th of July weekend. Would be nice to have produce specific goals too 
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Ingrid*: maybe take a stab at a new way to track all that - I'm still going to track the total business like we are doing, but on a daily/weekly we need to have Sharma report differently on pacing and performance
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Ingrid*: ha same minds
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Jourdan*: Yesss lol it’ll make narrowing down to needle movers much easier 
- **2025-07-03 15:36** *Ingrid*: I'm going to work on a doc for how I am thinking about seperating
- **2025-07-03 15:36** *Ingrid*: and then share with you
- **2025-07-03 15:42** *Ingrid*: will also give us a clean way to create a funnel for the full size sauna
- **2025-07-03 15:42** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good! Do we have any sales resources to take phone calls to sell that?
- **2025-07-07 14:50** *Ingrid*: Hey - I may be a few minutes late to the 1pm with Sharma - go ahead without me and I’ll call you after 
- **2025-07-07 14:50** *Ingrid*: Mainly want to make sure we are on track with the reconfiguration of the product funnels 
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good. Google performance looks solid with increase MTD but getting concenred about Meta CAC mtd. L7 looks okay but its ballooned and ill get an update on single product camps
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Ingrid*: I’m just at the dr and he is running late 
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Jourdan*: Okkkk! I hope everything is okay
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Ingrid*: Oh yea just a checkup 
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Jourdan*: Sounds good! Talk to you in a bit
- **2025-07-07 14:52** *Ingrid*: Also gentle reminder to do you performance marketing and DTC summary today
- **2025-07-07 14:52** *Jourdan*: Yesss ma’am saw the update come through (From Elyse) and have my calendar event\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-07 14:52** *Ingrid*: I’ll setup a weekly for us at 11am Mondays to review everything starting next week
- **2025-07-07 15:29** *Jourdan*: Call wrapped just some quick notes until we chat.  
  
• Campaigns shifted to single product by Wed EOD   
    ◦ Killing Legacy Campaigns (Holding Us Back)  
• Using Product Sets vs All Products in Meta Catalogs  
    ◦ Issue popped up w/ a bundle being served on IG that’s not avail on website.   
    ◦ Solution 1: Turn off product in Catalog so it doesn’t serve in Feed  
    ◦ Solution 2: Change in Shopify so there’s no chance of Shopify settings overruling Meta settings and showing the product as avail   
    ◦ Solution 3: Use Custom Product sets in Ads Manager featuring the Core 4. Could help w/ AOV and only serve DPA ads to high quality audiences which could lift performance on catalog campaigns.   
    ◦ I vote for Solution 2 and 3. SB doesn’t have ability to change on their end so this will need to be an internal update.   
• We’ve got a lot creative for PEMF and Sauna Blanket and some for Red Light Mask but could use more and not enough for Hat. Laura agreed to increase briefs for Hat &amp; Mask this week to be ready for Friday’s call. \n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-07 15:32** *Ingrid*: Agree - I like solution 3
- **2025-07-08 00:11** *Jourdan*: Here’s the written weekly report [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?usp=sharing)
- **2025-07-08 00:11** *Jourdan*: Elyse’s doc was updated earlier today
- **2025-07-08 00:12** *Jourdan*: I can include screenshots from Bark AI as those are inline with some of the images the previous GS provided
- **2025-07-08 09:59** *Jourdan*: If we’re not serving YT primarily then we may need to run some exclusions if possible. Not sure how i feel about these ads serving in Gmail and being effective
- **2025-07-08 10:00** *Jourdan*: Reminds me of an audience network placement on meta
- **2025-07-08 10:06** *Ingrid*: yea agree - bring it up on the google call?
- **2025-07-08 10:06** *Ingrid*: def chase jeremy
- **2025-07-08 10:07** *Ingrid*: thanks for staying on top of that - reviewing your summary now!
- **2025-07-08 10:08** *Jourdan*: You’re welcome! I just reached out to him. TT is the bad apple and if we can’t get it right i rather pull spend down and reallocate to AWIN or Google\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-08 10:08** *Jourdan*: AWIN looks juiiiiccyy with 35% increase in spend\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-08 10:25** *Ingrid*: yea we gave that channel the july 4th deal that only existed for affiliates!
- **2025-07-09 11:08** *Ingrid*: this would be compared to MNTN obviously
- **2025-07-09 11:09** *Ingrid*: need to evaluate which is better
- **2025-07-09 11:09** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am we’re on same page\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-09 11:09** *Jourdan*: Would be good to ask creative questions while we have them too\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-09 11:19** *Ingrid*: this is cool bc it's affilaite/sales based
- **2025-07-09 11:19** *Jourdan*: Could run both MNTN and this with them having two different goals
- **2025-07-09 11:20** *Jourdan*: Just curious what kind of offers they run on these channels w/ promos and QRs not being super effecitve
- **2025-07-09 11:21** *Ingrid*: yea, i guess my worry would be running them at the same time would inflate impact on both
- **2025-07-09 11:21** *Jourdan*: Yeah attribution could get muddy here since there’s no last touch
- **2025-07-09 11:22** *Ingrid*: word - let's pick one to start with then add the other
- **2025-07-09 11:22** *Ingrid*: let me know which you think is best to start
- **2025-07-09 11:23** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good. I’m 50/50 because there’s a lot of learnings to leverage from affiliates
- **2025-07-09 11:26** *Ingrid*: let's see what an adequest test budget would be
- **2025-07-09 11:26** *Ingrid*: we know MNTN is like 10-15k
- **2025-07-09 11:27** *Ingrid*: adequate*
- **2025-07-09 11:27** *Ingrid*: ah 15k
- **2025-07-09 11:28** *Jourdan*: Seems like we might get more bang for a buck with the $15k spent
- **2025-07-09 11:28** *Ingrid*: can you send the answers to these questions to her once she sends?
- **2025-07-09 11:29** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am
- **2025-07-09 13:39** *Jourdan*: Hey, just to keep you updated. Talked to Rahul  & Tori about scaling Google and adjusting T ROAS.  
  
We’re going to adjust T ROAS (15% Recommended by Google Rep) first. Continue w/ budget scale test for 30 days which ends 6.19.  
  
However a few campaigns aren’t scaling incrementally so we’ll make a judgement call on 6.19 to reduce spend.
- **2025-07-09 13:41** *Jourdan*: My thoughts… We push Google &amp; AWIN making Google our primary channel for spend while reducing dependency on Meta until we can meet a sub $800 CAC (1d, 1st time) KPI there. Already seeing this happen L30 with Google taking 35% of spend vs 31% on Meta. Ultimately we gotta get Meta more efficient so we don’t stress Google to hard and blow up CAC there’s a balance we need
- **2025-07-09 13:48** *Ingrid*: fully aligned and really appreciate the input and judgement call\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Jourdan*
- **2025-07-10 16:31** *Ingrid*: hey slack me if you need me on the call now
- **2025-07-10 16:31** *Ingrid*: i need to wrap up a few things and have already heard their thing
- **2025-07-10 16:31** *Ingrid*: im here just heads down
- **2025-07-10 16:33** *Jourdan*: Okay yeah no worries
- **2025-07-10 17:07** *Ingrid*: how did it go?
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: Still speaking with her but good so far
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: like the placement options they have
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: DOOH offering is pretty cool too
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: the others didn’t offer
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: Just wrapped
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: Starting recommended budget is a lot higher than the others but they also manage for us
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: $100-150k for 3 months
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: told her to come back with something in the 50-60k for 3 months
- **2025-07-10 17:22** *Jourdan*: They also mentioned canvases that surround the video creative featuring quotes and QR codes
- **2025-07-10 17:23** *Jourdan*: Liked that aspect because gives us the ability to incorporate messaging and give people option to visit website directly but after speaking with TV Scientific doesn’t seem that those are super effective
- **2025-07-10 17:23** *Jourdan*: she mentioned 30s videos as being most successful on their placements so gives a little more time for QR codes but still not that much
- **2025-07-10 17:31** *Ingrid*: ok yea, i def think they are too expensive for us and I'd suggest we start with the other 2
- **2025-07-10 17:31** *Ingrid*: how are our new campaigns doing this week
- **2025-07-10 17:33** *Ingrid*: also, loved your weekly one-pager. can you make one for YTD/H1?
- **2025-07-10 17:33** *Ingrid*: really want your analysis on how the year has been - what's been good, what needs to change, how we prep for H2
- **2025-07-10 17:39** *Ingrid*: i just left a few comments here for you too
- **2025-07-10 17:39** *Ingrid*: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?tab=t.0)\n\n📎 **GS | Weekly Report | 7.7.25** (gdoc, 133.2KB) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?tab=t.0)
- **2025-07-10 17:39** *Jourdan*: Okay yes i can work on the H1 breakdown\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-10 17:43** *Jourdan*: and we’re on day 2 so not a lot of data.  
  
However Red Light Hat is strongest campaign based on in platform data with 2.83 ROAS and $780 AOV  
Red Light Mask has one purchase a .50 ROAS  
PEMF Mat has one conversion at .9 ROAS  
Sauna Blanket has one conversion  at .08 ROAS but low AOV ($70) so i think it tracked a conversion from a different product
- **2025-07-10 17:43** *Jourdan*: $750/day budget across each of those campaigns
- **2025-07-10 17:45** *Jourdan*: I’d give til end of day 3 to assess
- **2025-07-10 17:54** *Ingrid*: ok cool - i LOVE having this level of product data
- **2025-07-10 17:55** *Ingrid*: let's try to move the needle on our YoY growth, down 6% is bad
- **2025-07-10 17:55** *Ingrid*: can you dig in and see where the bleeding is?
- **2025-07-10 18:09** *Jourdan*: Surface level, I’m sure you see this too but CVR is down 52%, AOV down 13%, and Return customer down 10%  although sessions are up 132%. Also seeing discounts higher ($52.7k) this month than last year ($38.7k).  [Discounts](https://admin.shopify.com/store/higherdose/analytics/reports/total*sales*by*product?ql=FROM+sales%0A++SHOW+net*items*sold%2C+gross*sales%2C+discounts%2C+returns%2C+net*sales%2C+taxes%2C%0A++++total*sales%0A++WHERE+product*title+IS+NOT+NULL%0A++GROUP+BY+product*title%2C+product*vendor%2C+product*type+WITH+TOTALS%2C%0A++++PERCENT*CHANGE%0A++SINCE+startOfMonth%280m%29+UNTIL+today%0A++COMPARE+TO+previous*year%0A++ORDER+BY+total*sales+DESC%0A++LIMIT+1000%0AVISUALIZE+total*sales+TYPE+horizontal_bar) doesn’t make sense since we didn’t have 4th of July sale.  
  
Sessions alone could explain CVR since we’re sending more traffic  
  
Sauna Blanket down 32% in Sales Rev but the Kit is up 26% so discrepancy isn’t that large.  
PEMF Pro Mat down 58%  
  
Silver lining, Body Sculptor has 32k in rev which makes up for some of the downtrends from existing products.
- **2025-07-10 18:16** *Jourdan*: How do we correct, push harder on Red Light Hat. Seems to be the most efficient product w/ paid media. This could improve Meta performance and drive more rev. However we need to improve Sauna Blanket and PEMF Mat paid media performance. Could be a creative solution or produce new landing page assets for those products.
- **2025-07-10 18:34** *Ingrid*: Can you please align with Laura for that creative brief due tomorrow
- **2025-07-10 18:34** *Ingrid*: Let’s include everything we need to push these softer comp products 
- **2025-07-10 18:34** *Ingrid*: She said you never go back to her?
- **2025-07-10 18:37** *Jourdan*: Looks like she tagged me in the brief last night (Im CST right now) but I just got back to her with a reply and added in Red Light Hat to her product mix\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-10 18:38** *Jourdan*: From what Jake shared we’ve got more Blanket and PEMF creative than Red Light
- **2025-07-10 18:38** *Jourdan*: however with sales being down we still need resources here to improve efficiency
- **2025-07-10 18:39** *Jourdan* 💬 10 replies: Do we want to focus on the Red Light Neck Enhancer?
- **2025-07-10 19:02** *Jourdan*: What products should we focus on for CTV? I know Core 4 for sure but are there any others we should include?
- **2025-07-10 19:03** *Jourdan*: Laura brought up Full Spectrum Sauna and mentioned Lauren has interest mixing topicals into our efforts  :eyes:
- **2025-07-10 20:12** *Ingrid*: I’d start with lifestyle and core 4 to start, it’s a good intro to the brand 
- **2025-07-10 20:12** *Ingrid*: Then we can add full size and topicals once we prove out the channel on the basics 
- **2025-07-10 20:13** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good
- **2025-07-10 20:13** *Jourdan*: thank you
- **2025-07-10 20:17** *Jourdan*: Okay any interest in Endorphin oil + sweat band, trans mag spray, and press?  
  
These are lower AOV so i assume keeping it to Red Light, PEMF, and SB to get us back on track would be ideal?
- **2025-07-11 17:06** *Ingrid*: Appreciate you being on top of sharma on those campaigns!
- **2025-07-11 17:10** *Jourdan*: Of course! I want to get this thing turned around asap. Meta can be a lot better which will lift the entire ecosystem and make rev targets at efficiency a bit easier. Seeing these segmented by product is so valuable! Thank you for being behind that push as well\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-11 17:23** *Ingrid*: Yes getting meta right will do soooo much 
- **2025-07-11 17:23** *Ingrid*: Go team 
- **2025-07-14 13:03** *Ingrid*: 2 min!
- **2025-07-14 13:06** *Ingrid*: here!
- **2025-07-14 13:06** *Jourdan*: had to run to bathroom
- **2025-07-14 13:06** *Jourdan*: be there in a sec

- **2025-07-14 13:39** *Jourdan*: Last question, are we looking at gross sales or net when looking at YOY?
- **2025-07-14 13:39** *Ingrid*: Net as it’s in Shopify 
- **2025-07-14 13:39** *Ingrid*: Sales after returns and discounts 
- **2025-07-14 13:43** *Jourdan*: Okay net is showing down 3%. It does look like we’ve got a good bit less of discount rev this year compared to last year but returns are up a lot.  
  
I’d expect net to be up YoY but returns make up the money saved with less discount rev.\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-07-14 at 13.38.39.png** (png, 136.7KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F095T0L78TE/screenshot_2025-07-14_at_13.38.39.png)
- **2025-07-14 13:44** *Ingrid*: It’s all solvable with more top line sales
- **2025-07-14 13:44** *Ingrid*: We need more cushion there 
- **2025-07-14 13:45** *Jourdan*: Yeah agreed

- **2025-07-15 11:14** *Ingrid*: Oh, man I really hope she is ok and I'm glad you're there to help her. Thanks so much for the heads up, I was super concerned!
- **2025-07-15 11:22** *Jourdan*: I think she will be just in a lot of pain. Thankfully her ortho reassured me and we’ll be able to get her to urgent care today so they can close it back up since it was glued. I’ll follow up with Sharma i see they reached out to lock in CAC
- **2025-07-15 11:59** *Ingrid*: ok, glad there is a plan to get her to a better place

“What percentage of your revenue comes from D2C, retail, and marketplace”  
  
W/ 36M on Shopify last 12 months I’m assuming retail and marketplace accounts are tracked off platform?  
Is it safe to say those 2 make up 20% of the total rev?\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-17 13:39** *Ingrid*: yes, 85% DTC
- **2025-07-17 13:39** *Ingrid*: rest retail/marketplace

- **2025-06-24 15:51** *Ingrid*: So we should test both ahead of holiday 
- **2025-06-24 15:52** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good. Are we close to launching Youtube? I remember mentions from one of the calls this week but not a timeline
- **2025-06-24 15:53** *Ingrid*: Yes! It’s in creative optimization as we speak 
- **2025-06-24 15:53** *Ingrid*: Should be ready to test in July - we can dig deeper soon

- **2025-06-25 13:03** *Jourdan*: Decile had a lot of interesting insights around customer data. Perfect tool to use for figuring out Paid Hero products and which lead to higher LTV
- **2025-06-25 13:03** *Jourdan*: The highdration kit was not on my radar at all
- **2025-06-25 13:03** *Ingrid*: yes! ok yea def dig into how we operationalize the decile data
- **2025-06-25 13:04** *Ingrid*: the highdraytion powder is gross imo
- **2025-06-25 13:04** *Ingrid*: we need a new formulation lol
- **2025-06-25 13:05** *Jourdan*: I think most have been given away for free at this point.  22% customer share ratio and and crazy 1st time rev so i feel like people we’re buying other products and this was a free gift + purchase item\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-25 at 11.04.43.png** (png, 190.7KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F093FM9AAKB/screenshot_2025-06-25_at_11.04.43.png)

- **2025-06-30 17:43** *Jourdan*: Basically should i update sales goal on july tab to 1.6 m because i see spend is at $350k
- **2025-06-30 20:49** *Ingrid*: Well let’s discuss it and align to a reasonable but but stretch goal to get everyone focused 
- **2025-06-30 20:50** *Ingrid*: I’ll review the doc tomorrow and then we can catch about H2 budgets and goals to make sure we are tracking to where we need to be on both spend and sales

- **2025-07-01 13:18** *Jourdan*: I left a formula key but if it doesn’t make sense let me know
- **2025-07-01 13:18** *Jourdan*: I could also project based on avg growth since 2023
- **2025-07-01 13:19** *Jourdan*: Also updated the YTD table to give data up until the quarter we’re viewing. So Q3 doesn’t include Q4  and Q2 doesn’t include Q3
- **2025-07-01 13:21** *Jourdan*: and added an efficiency column so we can track total return. I think these numbers will need to be played with a bit because efficiency takes a hit if we model it after last years growth
- **2025-07-01 13:21** *Ingrid*: yea def need to adjsut these a lot

- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Ingrid*: also - i need to skip the call with Bark, which is fine bc it's. good for you to meet them anyway and have them walk you through the platform
- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Ingrid*: i need to do amazon stuff with chris
- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Jourdan*: Okay no worries! I’ll get up to speed with them\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-02 14:23** *Jourdan*: Disruptors is Meta’s high level rep program. You get access to new products, have a rep with more leverage to get things done, run hold out test etc. Kinda gave me the vibes we had on the google call. Not sure if we’re in a special program there but i was surprised at the knowledge and access to tools.  You do have to qualify from a spend perspective over a quarter and I can assume Sharma has some brands in the program
- **2025-07-02 14:23** *Jourdan*: I’ve worked with 2 brands in it and it was a good experience. I’ll ask the team in one of our chats
- **2025-07-02 14:25** *Ingrid*: can you ask Sharma to get us into the program?
- **2025-07-02 14:27** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am for sure
- **2025-07-02 15:26** *Ingrid*: hey let me know when you're off with Bark
- **2025-07-02 15:26** *Ingrid*: I have more questions about these spreadsheet inputs
- **2025-07-02 15:27** *Jourdan*: I’m off call with them. Pretty useful platform to help navigate which products to put more creative and paid resources behind based on profit per view 
- **2025-07-02 15:27** *Jourdan*: Free for questions

- **2025-07-03 15:11** *Ingrid*: can you look back on June 2024 Meta to see what rev it delivered?
- **2025-07-03 15:11** *Ingrid*: this number for june 2024 feels off
- **2025-07-03 15:18** *Jourdan*: 319,286.56 is what I’m getting
- **2025-07-03 15:25** *Ingrid*: from Meta in June 2024?
- **2025-07-03 15:25** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am

- **2025-07-03 15:26** *Ingrid*: soooo weird
- **2025-07-03 15:27** *Ingrid*: Chris in his tracker has $227k in meta spend
- **2025-07-03 15:27** *Jourdan*: Meta + affiliate?
- **2025-07-03 15:27** *Ingrid*: just meta
- **2025-07-03 15:28** *Ingrid*: ill connect w him on it
- **2025-07-03 15:28** *Ingrid*: thank you
- **2025-07-03 15:30** *Jourdan*: Hmm ok ok it might include other channels since it’s paid social. I can check other channels for that time too
- **2025-07-03 15:32** *Ingrid*: he has it broken out as just meta - it's ok dont spin your wheels on this one
- **2025-07-03 15:32** *Ingrid*: i had a good long chat with Ari about changing all our campaigns to product funnels
- **2025-07-03 15:33** *Ingrid*: she is fully onboard and we can revisit on monday when we all chat
- **2025-07-03 15:34** *Jourdan*: Okay sweet, I followed up with Jake and he echoed that. They’ll kick it off next week he just wanted to align with SB team
- **2025-07-03 15:34** *Ingrid*: perf
- **2025-07-03 15:34** *Ingrid*: thank you! yea - we'll then need to adjust all our reporting and KPIS, yay
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Jourdan*: Didn’t want to kick anything new off over 4th of July weekend. Would be nice to have produce specific goals too 
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Ingrid*: maybe take a stab at a new way to track all that - I'm still going to track the total business like we are doing, but on a daily/weekly we need to have Sharma report differently on pacing and performance
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Ingrid*: ha same minds
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Jourdan*: Yesss lol it’ll make narrowing down to needle movers much easier 
- **2025-07-03 15:36** *Ingrid*: I'm going to work on a doc for how I am thinking about seperating
- **2025-07-03 15:36** *Ingrid*: and then share with you
- **2025-07-03 15:42** *Ingrid*: will also give us a clean way to create a funnel for the full size sauna
- **2025-07-03 15:42** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good! Do we have any sales resources to take phone calls to sell that?
- **2025-07-07 14:50** *Ingrid*: Hey - I may be a few minutes late to the 1pm with Sharma - go ahead without me and I’ll call you after 
- **2025-07-07 14:50** *Ingrid*: Mainly want to make sure we are on track with the reconfiguration of the product funnels 
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good. Google performance looks solid with increase MTD but getting concenred about Meta CAC mtd. L7 looks okay but its ballooned and ill get an update on single product camps
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Ingrid*: I’m just at the dr and he is running late 
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Jourdan*: Okkkk! I hope everything is okay
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Ingrid*: Oh yea just a checkup 
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Jourdan*: Sounds good! Talk to you in a bit
- **2025-07-07 14:52** *Ingrid*: Also gentle reminder to do you performance marketing and DTC summary today
- **2025-07-07 14:52** *Jourdan*: Yesss ma’am saw the update come through (From Elyse) and have my calendar event\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-07 14:52** *Ingrid*: I’ll setup a weekly for us at 11am Mondays to review everything starting next week
- **2025-07-07 15:29** *Jourdan*: Call wrapped just some quick notes until we chat.  
  
• Campaigns shifted to single product by Wed EOD   
    ◦ Killing Legacy Campaigns (Holding Us Back)  
• Using Product Sets vs All Products in Meta Catalogs  
    ◦ Issue popped up w/ a bundle being served on IG that’s not avail on website.   
    ◦ Solution 1: Turn off product in Catalog so it doesn’t serve in Feed  
    ◦ Solution 2: Change in Shopify so there’s no chance of Shopify settings overruling Meta settings and showing the product as avail   
    ◦ Solution 3: Use Custom Product sets in Ads Manager featuring the Core 4. Could help w/ AOV and only serve DPA ads to high quality audiences which could lift performance on catalog campaigns.   
    ◦ I vote for Solution 2 and 3. SB doesn’t have ability to change on their end so this will need to be an internal update.   
• We’ve got a lot creative for PEMF and Sauna Blanket and some for Red Light Mask but could use more and not enough for Hat. Laura agreed to increase briefs for Hat &amp; Mask this week to be ready for Friday’s call. \n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-07 15:32** *Ingrid*: Agree - I like solution 3
- **2025-07-08 00:11** *Jourdan*: Here’s the written weekly report [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?usp=sharing)
- **2025-07-08 00:11** *Jourdan*: Elyse’s doc was updated earlier today
- **2025-07-08 00:12** *Jourdan*: I can include screenshots from Bark AI as those are inline with some of the images the previous GS provided
- **2025-07-08 09:59** *Jourdan*: If we’re not serving YT primarily then we may need to run some exclusions if possible. Not sure how i feel about these ads serving in Gmail and being effective
- **2025-07-08 10:00** *Jourdan*: Reminds me of an audience network placement on meta
- **2025-07-08 10:06** *Ingrid*: yea agree - bring it up on the google call?
- **2025-07-08 10:06** *Ingrid*: def chase jeremy
- **2025-07-08 10:07** *Ingrid*: thanks for staying on top of that - reviewing your summary now!
- **2025-07-08 10:08** *Jourdan*: You’re welcome! I just reached out to him. TT is the bad apple and if we can’t get it right i rather pull spend down and reallocate to AWIN or Google\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-08 10:08** *Jourdan*: AWIN looks juiiiiccyy with 35% increase in spend\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-08 10:25** *Ingrid*: yea we gave that channel the july 4th deal that only existed for affiliates!
- **2025-07-09 11:08** *Ingrid*: this would be compared to MNTN obviously
- **2025-07-09 11:09** *Ingrid*: need to evaluate which is better
- **2025-07-09 11:09** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am we’re on same page\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-09 11:09** *Jourdan*: Would be good to ask creative questions while we have them too\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-09 11:19** *Ingrid*: this is cool bc it's affilaite/sales based
- **2025-07-09 11:19** *Jourdan*: Could run both MNTN and this with them having two different goals
- **2025-07-09 11:20** *Jourdan*: Just curious what kind of offers they run on these channels w/ promos and QRs not being super effecitve
- **2025-07-09 11:21** *Ingrid*: yea, i guess my worry would be running them at the same time would inflate impact on both
- **2025-07-09 11:21** *Jourdan*: Yeah attribution could get muddy here since there’s no last touch
- **2025-07-09 11:22** *Ingrid*: word - let's pick one to start with then add the other
- **2025-07-09 11:22** *Ingrid*: let me know which you think is best to start
- **2025-07-09 11:23** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good. I’m 50/50 because there’s a lot of learnings to leverage from affiliates
- **2025-07-09 11:26** *Ingrid*: let's see what an adequest test budget would be
- **2025-07-09 11:26** *Ingrid*: we know MNTN is like 10-15k
- **2025-07-09 11:27** *Ingrid*: adequate*
- **2025-07-09 11:27** *Ingrid*: ah 15k
- **2025-07-09 11:28** *Jourdan*: Seems like we might get more bang for a buck with the $15k spent
- **2025-07-09 11:28** *Ingrid*: can you send the answers to these questions to her once she sends?
- **2025-07-09 11:29** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am
- **2025-07-09 13:39** *Jourdan*: Hey, just to keep you updated. Talked to Rahul  & Tori about scaling Google and adjusting T ROAS.  
  
We’re going to adjust T ROAS (15% Recommended by Google Rep) first. Continue w/ budget scale test for 30 days which ends 6.19.  
  
However a few campaigns aren’t scaling incrementally so we’ll make a judgement call on 6.19 to reduce spend.
- **2025-07-09 13:41** *Jourdan*: My thoughts… We push Google &amp; AWIN making Google our primary channel for spend while reducing dependency on Meta until we can meet a sub $800 CAC (1d, 1st time) KPI there. Already seeing this happen L30 with Google taking 35% of spend vs 31% on Meta. Ultimately we gotta get Meta more efficient so we don’t stress Google to hard and blow up CAC there’s a balance we need
- **2025-07-09 13:48** *Ingrid*: fully aligned and really appreciate the input and judgement call\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Jourdan*
- **2025-07-10 16:31** *Ingrid*: hey slack me if you need me on the call now
- **2025-07-10 16:31** *Ingrid*: i need to wrap up a few things and have already heard their thing
- **2025-07-10 16:31** *Ingrid*: im here just heads down
- **2025-07-10 16:33** *Jourdan*: Okay yeah no worries
- **2025-07-10 17:07** *Ingrid*: how did it go?
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: Still speaking with her but good so far
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: like the placement options they have
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: DOOH offering is pretty cool too
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: the others didn’t offer
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: Just wrapped
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: Starting recommended budget is a lot higher than the others but they also manage for us
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: $100-150k for 3 months
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: told her to come back with something in the 50-60k for 3 months
- **2025-07-10 17:22** *Jourdan*: They also mentioned canvases that surround the video creative featuring quotes and QR codes
- **2025-07-10 17:23** *Jourdan*: Liked that aspect because gives us the ability to incorporate messaging and give people option to visit website directly but after speaking with TV Scientific doesn’t seem that those are super effective
- **2025-07-10 17:23** *Jourdan*: she mentioned 30s videos as being most successful on their placements so gives a little more time for QR codes but still not that much
- **2025-07-10 17:31** *Ingrid*: ok yea, i def think they are too expensive for us and I'd suggest we start with the other 2
- **2025-07-10 17:31** *Ingrid*: how are our new campaigns doing this week
- **2025-07-10 17:33** *Ingrid*: also, loved your weekly one-pager. can you make one for YTD/H1?
- **2025-07-10 17:33** *Ingrid*: really want your analysis on how the year has been - what's been good, what needs to change, how we prep for H2
- **2025-07-10 17:39** *Ingrid*: i just left a few comments here for you too
- **2025-07-10 17:39** *Ingrid*: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?tab=t.0)\n\n📎 **GS | Weekly Report | 7.7.25** (gdoc, 133.2KB) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?tab=t.0)
- **2025-07-10 17:39** *Jourdan*: Okay yes i can work on the H1 breakdown\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-10 17:43** *Jourdan*: and we’re on day 2 so not a lot of data.  
  
However Red Light Hat is strongest campaign based on in platform data with 2.83 ROAS and $780 AOV  
Red Light Mask has one purchase a .50 ROAS  
PEMF Mat has one conversion at .9 ROAS  
Sauna Blanket has one conversion  at .08 ROAS but low AOV ($70) so i think it tracked a conversion from a different product
- **2025-07-10 17:43** *Jourdan*: $750/day budget across each of those campaigns
- **2025-07-10 17:45** *Jourdan*: I’d give til end of day 3 to assess
- **2025-07-10 17:54** *Ingrid*: ok cool - i LOVE having this level of product data
- **2025-07-10 17:55** *Ingrid*: let's try to move the needle on our YoY growth, down 6% is bad
- **2025-07-10 17:55** *Ingrid*: can you dig in and see where the bleeding is?
- **2025-07-10 18:09** *Jourdan*: Surface level, I’m sure you see this too but CVR is down 52%, AOV down 13%, and Return customer down 10%  although sessions are up 132%. Also seeing discounts higher ($52.7k) this month than last year ($38.7k).  [Discounts](https://admin.shopify.com/store/higherdose/analytics/reports/total*sales*by*product?ql=FROM+sales%0A++SHOW+net*items*sold%2C+gross*sales%2C+discounts%2C+returns%2C+net*sales%2C+taxes%2C%0A++++total*sales%0A++WHERE+product*title+IS+NOT+NULL%0A++GROUP+BY+product*title%2C+product*vendor%2C+product*type+WITH+TOTALS%2C%0A++++PERCENT*CHANGE%0A++SINCE+startOfMonth%280m%29+UNTIL+today%0A++COMPARE+TO+previous*year%0A++ORDER+BY+total*sales+DESC%0A++LIMIT+1000%0AVISUALIZE+total*sales+TYPE+horizontal_bar) doesn’t make sense since we didn’t have 4th of July sale.  
  
Sessions alone could explain CVR since we’re sending more traffic  
  
Sauna Blanket down 32% in Sales Rev but the Kit is up 26% so discrepancy isn’t that large.  
PEMF Pro Mat down 58%  
  
Silver lining, Body Sculptor has 32k in rev which makes up for some of the downtrends from existing products.
- **2025-07-10 18:16** *Jourdan*: How do we correct, push harder on Red Light Hat. Seems to be the most efficient product w/ paid media. This could improve Meta performance and drive more rev. However we need to improve Sauna Blanket and PEMF Mat paid media performance. Could be a creative solution or produce new landing page assets for those products.
- **2025-07-10 18:34** *Ingrid*: Can you please align with Laura for that creative brief due tomorrow
- **2025-07-10 18:34** *Ingrid*: Let’s include everything we need to push these softer comp products 
- **2025-07-10 18:34** *Ingrid*: She said you never go back to her?
- **2025-07-10 18:37** *Jourdan*: Looks like she tagged me in the brief last night (Im CST right now) but I just got back to her with a reply and added in Red Light Hat to her product mix\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-10 18:38** *Jourdan*: From what Jake shared we’ve got more Blanket and PEMF creative than Red Light
- **2025-07-10 18:38** *Jourdan*: however with sales being down we still need resources here to improve efficiency
- **2025-07-10 18:39** *Jourdan* 💬 10 replies: Do we want to focus on the Red Light Neck Enhancer?
- **2025-07-10 19:02** *Jourdan*: What products should we focus on for CTV? I know Core 4 for sure but are there any others we should include?
- **2025-07-10 19:03** *Jourdan*: Laura brought up Full Spectrum Sauna and mentioned Lauren has interest mixing topicals into our efforts  :eyes:
- **2025-07-10 20:12** *Ingrid*: I’d start with lifestyle and core 4 to start, it’s a good intro to the brand 
- **2025-07-10 20:12** *Ingrid*: Then we can add full size and topicals once we prove out the channel on the basics 
- **2025-07-10 20:13** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good
- **2025-07-10 20:13** *Jourdan*: thank you
- **2025-07-10 20:17** *Jourdan*: Okay any interest in Endorphin oil + sweat band, trans mag spray, and press?  
  
These are lower AOV so i assume keeping it to Red Light, PEMF, and SB to get us back on track would be ideal?
- **2025-07-11 17:06** *Ingrid*: Appreciate you being on top of sharma on those campaigns!
- **2025-07-11 17:10** *Jourdan*: Of course! I want to get this thing turned around asap. Meta can be a lot better which will lift the entire ecosystem and make rev targets at efficiency a bit easier. Seeing these segmented by product is so valuable! Thank you for being behind that push as well\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-11 17:23** *Ingrid*: Yes getting meta right will do soooo much 
- **2025-07-11 17:23** *Ingrid*: Go team 
- **2025-07-14 13:03** *Ingrid*: 2 min!
- **2025-07-14 13:06** *Ingrid*: here!

- **2025-07-14 13:39** *Jourdan*: Last question, are we looking at gross sales or net when looking at YOY?
- **2025-07-14 13:39** *Ingrid*: Net as it’s in Shopify 
- **2025-07-14 13:39** *Ingrid*: Sales after returns and discounts 
- **2025-07-14 13:43** *Jourdan*: Okay net is showing down 3%. It does look like we’ve got a good bit less of discount rev this year compared to last year but returns are up a lot.  
  
I’d expect net to be up YoY but returns make up the money saved with less discount rev.\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-07-14 at 13.38.39.png** (png, 136.7KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F095T0L78TE/screenshot_2025-07-14_at_13.38.39.png)
- **2025-07-14 13:44** *Ingrid*: It’s all solvable with more top line sales
- **2025-07-14 13:44** *Ingrid*: We need more cushion there 
- **2025-07-14 13:45** *Jourdan*: Yeah agreed
- **2025-07-14 13:46** *Jourdan*: we’ve got like a 4 day buffer before Google recommends we bump budgets again. Speaking with Anastasia now on increasing\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*

- **2025-07-15 10:48** *Jourdan*: Hey @Ingrid My mom fell this morning and opened her incision so I’ve been on the phone with her ortho’s office figuring out what to do. I’m sorry for the late heads up I’m just a little overwhelmed 
- **2025-07-15 11:14** *Ingrid*: Oh, man I really hope she is ok and I'm glad you're there to help her. Thanks so much for the heads up, I was super concerned!
- **2025-07-15 11:22** *Jourdan*: I think she will be just in a lot of pain. Thankfully her ortho reassured me and we’ll be able to get her to urgent care today so they can close it back up since it was glued. I’ll follow up with Sharma i see they reached out to lock in CAC
- **2025-07-15 11:59** *Ingrid*: ok, glad there is a plan to get her to a better place
- **2025-07-16 13:33** *Jourdan*: Hey I got back to your email and followed up with meta team but they’re in Tel Aviv.   
  
Your mornings next week are a little full but checking to see if you have flexibility for anything morning cst/est after Mon &amp; Tue?
- **2025-07-16 13:57** *Ingrid*: Ah, I'm actually out Mon/Tues next week but I think you and Sharma to should meet them anyway (without me)
- **2025-07-16 13:57** *Ingrid*: so go ahead and book what works for everyone else
- **2025-07-16 14:01** *Jourdan*: Okay I saw you were OOO so sent times that worked with with your schedule but seems like mornings are best for everyone so I’ll follow up with them. \n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*

- **2025-07-17 11:40** *Jourdan*: Yes i was but stepped away to the bathroom so missed that question. Here’s my notes from the convo  
  
**Action Items / Takeaways**  
• Sharma to **move forward with creative concept** focused on starter kits for younger kids.  
• Test **talking head format** with VO as preferred option.  
• Clarify **usage rights** on existing UGC content.

- **2025-07-17 13:06** *Jourdan*: Hey, im following up with Gui and need clarity around % of revenue  
  
“What percentage of your revenue comes from D2C, retail, and marketplace”  
  
W/ 36M on Shopify last 12 months I’m assuming retail and marketplace accounts are tracked off platform?  
Is it safe to say those 2 make up 20% of the total rev?\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-17 13:39** *Ingrid*: yes, 85% DTC
- **2025-07-17 13:39** *Ingrid*: rest retail/marketplace

- **2025-07-24 10:50** *Ingrid*: im open to it if we are very good about our segmentations and not blasting everyone everyday
- **2025-07-24 10:55** *Jourdan*: Yeah for sure it would have to be something we work up to so people are used to the cadence and we’ll have to be driving enough new subscribers

- **2025-07-01 13:19** *Jourdan*: Also updated the YTD table to give data up until the quarter we’re viewing. So Q3 doesn’t include Q4  and Q2 doesn’t include Q3
- **2025-07-01 13:21** *Jourdan*: and added an efficiency column so we can track total return. I think these numbers will need to be played with a bit because efficiency takes a hit if we model it after last years growth
- **2025-07-01 13:21** *Ingrid*: yea def need to adjsut these a lot
- **2025-07-01 13:22** *Ingrid*: the goal I have for total 2025 is 20% Growth	22%	5%	$8,307,513	$37,083,320

- **2025-07-01 13:22** *Ingrid*: yours is on top and my goal are on bottom
- **2025-07-01 13:23** *Ingrid*: with the highlighted being the key goal
- **2025-07-01 13:24** *Ingrid*: the previous years data is all over the place so not the best guideline
- **2025-07-01 13:24** *Jourdan*: Okay cool cool adjusting now
- **2025-07-01 13:24** *Ingrid*: thank you!
- **2025-07-01 13:24** *Jourdan*: You’re welcome
- **2025-07-01 19:57** *Jourdan*: Made those updates. Spend in Q1 Summary didn’t reflect Affiliate spend so i updated that. If you check Q4 summary the totals are inline with your projections
- **2025-07-01 19:57** *Jourdan*: We just have to get super efficient the remainder of the year
- **2025-07-01 20:00** *Jourdan*: Moving to EOM and H1 reports 
- **2025-07-02 14:05** *Jourdan*: Are you familiar with the disruptors program at Meta?
- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Ingrid*: hi! im not - but tell me about it!
- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Ingrid*: also - i need to skip the call with Bark, which is fine bc it's. good for you to meet them anyway and have them walk you through the platform
- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Ingrid*: i need to do amazon stuff with chris
- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Jourdan*: Okay no worries! I’ll get up to speed with them\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-02 14:23** *Jourdan*: Disruptors is Meta’s high level rep program. You get access to new products, have a rep with more leverage to get things done, run hold out test etc. Kinda gave me the vibes we had on the google call. Not sure if we’re in a special program there but i was surprised at the knowledge and access to tools.  You do have to qualify from a spend perspective over a quarter and I can assume Sharma has some brands in the program
- **2025-07-02 14:23** *Jourdan*: I’ve worked with 2 brands in it and it was a good experience. I’ll ask the team in one of our chats
- **2025-07-02 14:25** *Ingrid*: can you ask Sharma to get us into the program?
- **2025-07-02 14:27** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am for sure
- **2025-07-02 15:26** *Ingrid*: hey let me know when you're off with Bark
- **2025-07-02 15:26** *Ingrid*: I have more questions about these spreadsheet inputs
- **2025-07-02 15:27** *Jourdan*: I’m off call with them. Pretty useful platform to help navigate which products to put more creative and paid resources behind based on profit per view 
- **2025-07-02 15:27** *Jourdan*: Free for questions 
- **2025-07-02 15:29** *Ingrid*: ok cool - calling you now

- **2025-07-03 15:11** *Ingrid*: can you look back on June 2024 Meta to see what rev it delivered?
- **2025-07-03 15:11** *Ingrid*: this number for june 2024 feels off

- **2025-07-03 15:26** *Ingrid*: soooo weird
- **2025-07-03 15:27** *Ingrid*: Chris in his tracker has $227k in meta spend
- **2025-07-03 15:27** *Jourdan*: Meta + affiliate?
- **2025-07-03 15:27** *Ingrid*: just meta
- **2025-07-03 15:28** *Ingrid*: ill connect w him on it
- **2025-07-03 15:28** *Ingrid*: thank you
- **2025-07-03 15:30** *Jourdan*: Hmm ok ok it might include other channels since it’s paid social. I can check other channels for that time too
- **2025-07-03 15:32** *Ingrid*: he has it broken out as just meta - it's ok dont spin your wheels on this one
- **2025-07-03 15:32** *Ingrid*: i had a good long chat with Ari about changing all our campaigns to product funnels
- **2025-07-03 15:33** *Ingrid*: she is fully onboard and we can revisit on monday when we all chat
- **2025-07-03 15:34** *Jourdan*: Okay sweet, I followed up with Jake and he echoed that. They’ll kick it off next week he just wanted to align with SB team
- **2025-07-03 15:34** *Ingrid*: perf
- **2025-07-03 15:34** *Ingrid*: thank you! yea - we'll then need to adjust all our reporting and KPIS, yay
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Jourdan*: Didn’t want to kick anything new off over 4th of July weekend. Would be nice to have produce specific goals too 
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Ingrid*: maybe take a stab at a new way to track all that - I'm still going to track the total business like we are doing, but on a daily/weekly we need to have Sharma report differently on pacing and performance
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Ingrid*: ha same minds
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Jourdan*: Yesss lol it’ll make narrowing down to needle movers much easier 
- **2025-07-03 15:36** *Ingrid*: I'm going to work on a doc for how I am thinking about seperating
- **2025-07-03 15:36** *Ingrid*: and then share with you
- **2025-07-03 15:42** *Ingrid*: will also give us a clean way to create a funnel for the full size sauna
- **2025-07-03 15:42** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good! Do we have any sales resources to take phone calls to sell that?
- **2025-07-07 14:50** *Ingrid*: Hey - I may be a few minutes late to the 1pm with Sharma - go ahead without me and I’ll call you after 
- **2025-07-07 14:50** *Ingrid*: Mainly want to make sure we are on track with the reconfiguration of the product funnels 
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good. Google performance looks solid with increase MTD but getting concenred about Meta CAC mtd. L7 looks okay but its ballooned and ill get an update on single product camps
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Ingrid*: I’m just at the dr and he is running late 
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Jourdan*: Okkkk! I hope everything is okay
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Ingrid*: Oh yea just a checkup 
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Jourdan*: Sounds good! Talk to you in a bit
- **2025-07-07 14:52** *Ingrid*: Also gentle reminder to do you performance marketing and DTC summary today
- **2025-07-07 14:52** *Jourdan*: Yesss ma’am saw the update come through (From Elyse) and have my calendar event\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-07 14:52** *Ingrid*: I’ll setup a weekly for us at 11am Mondays to review everything starting next week
- **2025-07-07 15:29** *Jourdan*: Call wrapped just some quick notes until we chat.  
  
• Campaigns shifted to single product by Wed EOD   
    ◦ Killing Legacy Campaigns (Holding Us Back)  
• Using Product Sets vs All Products in Meta Catalogs  
    ◦ Issue popped up w/ a bundle being served on IG that’s not avail on website.   
    ◦ Solution 1: Turn off product in Catalog so it doesn’t serve in Feed  
    ◦ Solution 2: Change in Shopify so there’s no chance of Shopify settings overruling Meta settings and showing the product as avail   
    ◦ Solution 3: Use Custom Product sets in Ads Manager featuring the Core 4. Could help w/ AOV and only serve DPA ads to high quality audiences which could lift performance on catalog campaigns.   
    ◦ I vote for Solution 2 and 3. SB doesn’t have ability to change on their end so this will need to be an internal update.   
• We’ve got a lot creative for PEMF and Sauna Blanket and some for Red Light Mask but could use more and not enough for Hat. Laura agreed to increase briefs for Hat &amp; Mask this week to be ready for Friday’s call. \n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-07 15:32** *Ingrid*: Agree - I like solution 3
- **2025-07-08 00:11** *Jourdan*: Here’s the written weekly report [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?usp=sharing)
- **2025-07-08 00:11** *Jourdan*: Elyse’s doc was updated earlier today
- **2025-07-08 00:12** *Jourdan*: I can include screenshots from Bark AI as those are inline with some of the images the previous GS provided
- **2025-07-08 09:59** *Jourdan*: If we’re not serving YT primarily then we may need to run some exclusions if possible. Not sure how i feel about these ads serving in Gmail and being effective
- **2025-07-08 10:00** *Jourdan*: Reminds me of an audience network placement on meta
- **2025-07-08 10:06** *Ingrid*: yea agree - bring it up on the google call?
- **2025-07-08 10:06** *Ingrid*: def chase jeremy
- **2025-07-08 10:07** *Ingrid*: thanks for staying on top of that - reviewing your summary now!
- **2025-07-08 10:08** *Jourdan*: You’re welcome! I just reached out to him. TT is the bad apple and if we can’t get it right i rather pull spend down and reallocate to AWIN or Google\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-08 10:08** *Jourdan*: AWIN looks juiiiiccyy with 35% increase in spend\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-08 10:25** *Ingrid*: yea we gave that channel the july 4th deal that only existed for affiliates!
- **2025-07-09 11:08** *Ingrid*: this would be compared to MNTN obviously
- **2025-07-09 11:09** *Ingrid*: need to evaluate which is better
- **2025-07-09 11:09** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am we’re on same page\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-09 11:09** *Jourdan*: Would be good to ask creative questions while we have them too\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-09 11:19** *Ingrid*: this is cool bc it's affilaite/sales based
- **2025-07-09 11:19** *Jourdan*: Could run both MNTN and this with them having two different goals
- **2025-07-09 11:20** *Jourdan*: Just curious what kind of offers they run on these channels w/ promos and QRs not being super effecitve
- **2025-07-09 11:21** *Ingrid*: yea, i guess my worry would be running them at the same time would inflate impact on both
- **2025-07-09 11:21** *Jourdan*: Yeah attribution could get muddy here since there’s no last touch
- **2025-07-09 11:22** *Ingrid*: word - let's pick one to start with then add the other
- **2025-07-09 11:22** *Ingrid*: let me know which you think is best to start
- **2025-07-09 11:23** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good. I’m 50/50 because there’s a lot of learnings to leverage from affiliates
- **2025-07-09 11:26** *Ingrid*: let's see what an adequest test budget would be
- **2025-07-09 11:26** *Ingrid*: we know MNTN is like 10-15k
- **2025-07-09 11:27** *Ingrid*: adequate*
- **2025-07-09 11:27** *Ingrid*: ah 15k
- **2025-07-09 11:28** *Jourdan*: Seems like we might get more bang for a buck with the $15k spent
- **2025-07-09 11:28** *Ingrid*: can you send the answers to these questions to her once she sends?
- **2025-07-09 11:29** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am
- **2025-07-09 13:39** *Jourdan*: Hey, just to keep you updated. Talked to Rahul  & Tori about scaling Google and adjusting T ROAS.  
  
We’re going to adjust T ROAS (15% Recommended by Google Rep) first. Continue w/ budget scale test for 30 days which ends 6.19.  
  
However a few campaigns aren’t scaling incrementally so we’ll make a judgement call on 6.19 to reduce spend.
- **2025-07-09 13:41** *Jourdan*: My thoughts… We push Google &amp; AWIN making Google our primary channel for spend while reducing dependency on Meta until we can meet a sub $800 CAC (1d, 1st time) KPI there. Already seeing this happen L30 with Google taking 35% of spend vs 31% on Meta. Ultimately we gotta get Meta more efficient so we don’t stress Google to hard and blow up CAC there’s a balance we need
- **2025-07-09 13:48** *Ingrid*: fully aligned and really appreciate the input and judgement call\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Jourdan*
- **2025-07-10 16:31** *Ingrid*: hey slack me if you need me on the call now
- **2025-07-10 16:31** *Ingrid*: i need to wrap up a few things and have already heard their thing
- **2025-07-10 16:31** *Ingrid*: im here just heads down
- **2025-07-10 16:33** *Jourdan*: Okay yeah no worries
- **2025-07-10 17:07** *Ingrid*: how did it go?
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: Still speaking with her but good so far
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: like the placement options they have
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: DOOH offering is pretty cool too
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: the others didn’t offer
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: Just wrapped
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: Starting recommended budget is a lot higher than the others but they also manage for us
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: $100-150k for 3 months
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: told her to come back with something in the 50-60k for 3 months
- **2025-07-10 17:22** *Jourdan*: They also mentioned canvases that surround the video creative featuring quotes and QR codes
- **2025-07-10 17:23** *Jourdan*: Liked that aspect because gives us the ability to incorporate messaging and give people option to visit website directly but after speaking with TV Scientific doesn’t seem that those are super effective
- **2025-07-10 17:23** *Jourdan*: she mentioned 30s videos as being most successful on their placements so gives a little more time for QR codes but still not that much
- **2025-07-10 17:31** *Ingrid*: ok yea, i def think they are too expensive for us and I'd suggest we start with the other 2
- **2025-07-10 17:31** *Ingrid*: how are our new campaigns doing this week
- **2025-07-10 17:33** *Ingrid*: also, loved your weekly one-pager. can you make one for YTD/H1?
- **2025-07-10 17:33** *Ingrid*: really want your analysis on how the year has been - what's been good, what needs to change, how we prep for H2
- **2025-07-10 17:39** *Ingrid*: i just left a few comments here for you too
- **2025-07-10 17:39** *Ingrid*: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?tab=t.0)\n\n📎 **GS | Weekly Report | 7.7.25** (gdoc, 133.2KB) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?tab=t.0)
- **2025-07-10 17:39** *Jourdan*: Okay yes i can work on the H1 breakdown\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-10 17:43** *Jourdan*: and we’re on day 2 so not a lot of data.  
  
However Red Light Hat is strongest campaign based on in platform data with 2.83 ROAS and $780 AOV  
Red Light Mask has one purchase a .50 ROAS  
PEMF Mat has one conversion at .9 ROAS  
Sauna Blanket has one conversion  at .08 ROAS but low AOV ($70) so i think it tracked a conversion from a different product
- **2025-07-10 17:43** *Jourdan*: $750/day budget across each of those campaigns
- **2025-07-10 17:45** *Jourdan*: I’d give til end of day 3 to assess
- **2025-07-10 17:54** *Ingrid*: ok cool - i LOVE having this level of product data
- **2025-07-10 17:55** *Ingrid*: let's try to move the needle on our YoY growth, down 6% is bad
- **2025-07-10 17:55** *Ingrid*: can you dig in and see where the bleeding is?
- **2025-07-10 18:09** *Jourdan*: Surface level, I’m sure you see this too but CVR is down 52%, AOV down 13%, and Return customer down 10%  although sessions are up 132%. Also seeing discounts higher ($52.7k) this month than last year ($38.7k).  [Discounts](https://admin.shopify.com/store/higherdose/analytics/reports/total*sales*by*product?ql=FROM+sales%0A++SHOW+net*items*sold%2C+gross*sales%2C+discounts%2C+returns%2C+net*sales%2C+taxes%2C%0A++++total*sales%0A++WHERE+product*title+IS+NOT+NULL%0A++GROUP+BY+product*title%2C+product*vendor%2C+product*type+WITH+TOTALS%2C%0A++++PERCENT*CHANGE%0A++SINCE+startOfMonth%280m%29+UNTIL+today%0A++COMPARE+TO+previous*year%0A++ORDER+BY+total*sales+DESC%0A++LIMIT+1000%0AVISUALIZE+total*sales+TYPE+horizontal_bar) doesn’t make sense since we didn’t have 4th of July sale.  
  
Sessions alone could explain CVR since we’re sending more traffic  
  
Sauna Blanket down 32% in Sales Rev but the Kit is up 26% so discrepancy isn’t that large.  
PEMF Pro Mat down 58%  
  
Silver lining, Body Sculptor has 32k in rev which makes up for some of the downtrends from existing products.
- **2025-07-10 18:16** *Jourdan*: How do we correct, push harder on Red Light Hat. Seems to be the most efficient product w/ paid media. This could improve Meta performance and drive more rev. However we need to improve Sauna Blanket and PEMF Mat paid media performance. Could be a creative solution or produce new landing page assets for those products.
- **2025-07-10 18:34** *Ingrid*: Can you please align with Laura for that creative brief due tomorrow
- **2025-07-10 18:34** *Ingrid*: Let’s include everything we need to push these softer comp products 
- **2025-07-10 18:34** *Ingrid*: She said you never go back to her?
- **2025-07-10 18:37** *Jourdan*: Looks like she tagged me in the brief last night (Im CST right now) but I just got back to her with a reply and added in Red Light Hat to her product mix\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-10 18:38** *Jourdan*: From what Jake shared we’ve got more Blanket and PEMF creative than Red Light
- **2025-07-10 18:38** *Jourdan*: however with sales being down we still need resources here to improve efficiency
- **2025-07-10 18:39** *Jourdan* 💬 10 replies: Do we want to focus on the Red Light Neck Enhancer?
- **2025-07-10 19:02** *Jourdan*: What products should we focus on for CTV? I know Core 4 for sure but are there any others we should include?
- **2025-07-10 19:03** *Jourdan*: Laura brought up Full Spectrum Sauna and mentioned Lauren has interest mixing topicals into our efforts  :eyes:
- **2025-07-10 20:12** *Ingrid*: I’d start with lifestyle and core 4 to start, it’s a good intro to the brand 
- **2025-07-10 20:12** *Ingrid*: Then we can add full size and topicals once we prove out the channel on the basics 
- **2025-07-10 20:13** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good
- **2025-07-10 20:13** *Jourdan*: thank you
- **2025-07-10 20:17** *Jourdan*: Okay any interest in Endorphin oil + sweat band, trans mag spray, and press?  
  
These are lower AOV so i assume keeping it to Red Light, PEMF, and SB to get us back on track would be ideal?
- **2025-07-11 17:06** *Ingrid*: Appreciate you being on top of sharma on those campaigns!
- **2025-07-11 17:10** *Jourdan*: Of course! I want to get this thing turned around asap. Meta can be a lot better which will lift the entire ecosystem and make rev targets at efficiency a bit easier. Seeing these segmented by product is so valuable! Thank you for being behind that push as well\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-11 17:23** *Ingrid*: Yes getting meta right will do soooo much 
- **2025-07-11 17:23** *Ingrid*: Go team 
- **2025-07-14 13:03** *Ingrid*: 2 min!

- **2025-07-14 13:39** *Jourdan*: Last question, are we looking at gross sales or net when looking at YOY?
- **2025-07-14 13:39** *Ingrid*: Net as it’s in Shopify 
- **2025-07-14 13:39** *Ingrid*: Sales after returns and discounts 
- **2025-07-14 13:43** *Jourdan*: Okay net is showing down 3%. It does look like we’ve got a good bit less of discount rev this year compared to last year but returns are up a lot.  
  
I’d expect net to be up YoY but returns make up the money saved with less discount rev.\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-07-14 at 13.38.39.png** (png, 136.7KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F095T0L78TE/screenshot_2025-07-14_at_13.38.39.png)
- **2025-07-14 13:44** *Ingrid*: It’s all solvable with more top line sales
- **2025-07-14 13:44** *Ingrid*: We need more cushion there 
- **2025-07-14 13:45** *Jourdan*: Yeah agreed
- **2025-07-14 13:46** *Jourdan*: we’ve got like a 4 day buffer before Google recommends we bump budgets again. Speaking with Anastasia now on increasing\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-14 13:48** *Ingrid*: Ok cool. I’m going to skip the 1pm sharma call but I’d like you to join and tell them what we jsut discussed (the sales gap, the wanting new top of funnel drivers) and let me know what they say. I’ll be on the tomorrow morning call though of course 
- **2025-07-14 13:48** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good
- **2025-07-15 09:34** *Ingrid*: hey jourdan are you joining this sharma call?
- **2025-07-15 10:48** *Jourdan*: Hey @Ingrid My mom fell this morning and opened her incision so I’ve been on the phone with her ortho’s office figuring out what to do. I’m sorry for the late heads up I’m just a little overwhelmed 
- **2025-07-15 11:14** *Ingrid*: Oh, man I really hope she is ok and I'm glad you're there to help her. Thanks so much for the heads up, I was super concerned!
- **2025-07-15 11:22** *Jourdan*: I think she will be just in a lot of pain. Thankfully her ortho reassured me and we’ll be able to get her to urgent care today so they can close it back up since it was glued. I’ll follow up with Sharma i see they reached out to lock in CAC
- **2025-07-15 11:59** *Ingrid*: ok, glad there is a plan to get her to a better place
- **2025-07-16 13:33** *Jourdan*: Hey I got back to your email and followed up with meta team but they’re in Tel Aviv.   
  
Your mornings next week are a little full but checking to see if you have flexibility for anything morning cst/est after Mon &amp; Tue?
- **2025-07-16 13:57** *Ingrid*: Ah, I'm actually out Mon/Tues next week but I think you and Sharma to should meet them anyway (without me)
- **2025-07-16 13:57** *Ingrid*: so go ahead and book what works for everyone else
- **2025-07-16 14:01** *Jourdan*: Okay I saw you were OOO so sent times that worked with with your schedule but seems like mornings are best for everyone so I’ll follow up with them. \n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*

- **2025-07-17 11:40** *Jourdan*: Yes i was but stepped away to the bathroom so missed that question. Here’s my notes from the convo  
  
**Action Items / Takeaways**  
• Sharma to **move forward with creative concept** focused on starter kits for younger kids.  
• Test **talking head format** with VO as preferred option.  
• Clarify **usage rights** on existing UGC content.  
• Identify assets that align with Ingrid’s vision of **elevated lifestyle and rituals**.  
• Ensure collaboration and **emotional clarity** among key stakeholders to reduce friction.

- **2025-07-17 13:06** *Jourdan*: Hey, im following up with Gui and need clarity around % of revenue  
  
“What percentage of your revenue comes from D2C, retail, and marketplace”  
  
W/ 36M on Shopify last 12 months I’m assuming retail and marketplace accounts are tracked off platform?  
Is it safe to say those 2 make up 20% of the total rev?\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-17 13:39** *Ingrid*: yes, 85% DTC
- **2025-07-17 13:39** *Ingrid*: rest retail/marketplace

- **2025-07-24 10:50** *Ingrid*: im open to it if we are very good about our segmentations and not blasting everyone everyday
- **2025-07-24 10:55** *Jourdan*: Yeah for sure it would have to be something we work up to so people are used to the cadence and we’ll have to be driving enough new subscribers 
- **2025-07-24 10:55** *Jourdan*: Wanted to run it by you before I push for it with Elyse and Sharma. I know Elyse has a few bigger projects she’s working on

- **2025-06-30 17:42** *Jourdan*: Is the 1.6 m on $350k in spend is for all paid channels and is that Shopify Rev only?
- **2025-06-30 17:43** *Jourdan*: Basically should i update sales goal on july tab to 1.6 m because i see spend is at $350k
- **2025-06-30 20:49** *Ingrid*: Well let’s discuss it and align to a reasonable but but stretch goal to get everyone focused 
- **2025-06-30 20:50** *Ingrid*: I’ll review the doc tomorrow and then we can catch about H2 budgets and goals to make sure we are tracking to where we need to be on both spend and sales 
- **2025-06-30 20:52** *Jourdan*: Okay awesome I’ll work on individual months so we have some starting projections to work with 
- **2025-06-30 20:52** *Ingrid*: Perfect, thank you!
- **2025-07-01 09:35** *Ingrid*: hey jourdan are you joining the sharma call?
- **2025-07-01 10:39** *Ingrid*: hey, I don't see the media and performance summary in the weekly deck yet and it's due each monday EOD - how can I help make sure this is complete?
- **2025-07-01 11:35** *Jourdan*: Ahh so sorry that slipped my mind yesterday. I’ll create a reminder on my calendar to complete EOD. I’ll start updating it now \n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-01 11:45** *Jourdan*: I see its been completed, I’ll keep this same format for next week. I changed it last week and there’s a handful of new metrics that people may not be familiar with
- **2025-07-01 11:56** *Ingrid*: ok great - can you do one that is H1 now that it's over?
- **2025-07-01 11:57** *Jourdan*: So DTC performance recap from Jan to June right?
- **2025-07-01 12:00** *Ingrid*: Yes please 
- **2025-07-01 13:17** *Jourdan*: Updated Summaries with projections
- **2025-07-01 13:17** *Jourdan*: Used previous years growth and applied to sales and spend to get 2025 projections
- **2025-07-01 13:18** *Jourdan*: I left a formula key but if it doesn’t make sense let me know
- **2025-07-01 13:18** *Jourdan*: I could also project based on avg growth since 2023
- **2025-07-01 13:19** *Jourdan*: Also updated the YTD table to give data up until the quarter we’re viewing. So Q3 doesn’t include Q4  and Q2 doesn’t include Q3
- **2025-07-01 13:21** *Jourdan*: and added an efficiency column so we can track total return. I think these numbers will need to be played with a bit because efficiency takes a hit if we model it after last years growth
- **2025-07-01 13:21** *Ingrid*: yea def need to adjsut these a lot
- **2025-07-01 13:22** *Ingrid*: the goal I have for total 2025 is 20% Growth	22%	5%	$8,307,513	$37,083,320

- **2025-07-01 13:22** *Ingrid*: yours is on top and my goal are on bottom
- **2025-07-01 13:23** *Ingrid*: with the highlighted being the key goal
- **2025-07-01 13:24** *Ingrid*: the previous years data is all over the place so not the best guideline
- **2025-07-01 13:24** *Jourdan*: Okay cool cool adjusting now
- **2025-07-01 13:24** *Ingrid*: thank you!
- **2025-07-01 13:24** *Jourdan*: You’re welcome
- **2025-07-01 19:57** *Jourdan*: Made those updates. Spend in Q1 Summary didn’t reflect Affiliate spend so i updated that. If you check Q4 summary the totals are inline with your projections
- **2025-07-01 19:57** *Jourdan*: We just have to get super efficient the remainder of the year
- **2025-07-01 20:00** *Jourdan*: Moving to EOM and H1 reports 
- **2025-07-02 14:05** *Jourdan*: Are you familiar with the disruptors program at Meta?
- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Ingrid*: hi! im not - but tell me about it!
- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Ingrid*: also - i need to skip the call with Bark, which is fine bc it's. good for you to meet them anyway and have them walk you through the platform
- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Ingrid*: i need to do amazon stuff with chris
- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Jourdan*: Okay no worries! I’ll get up to speed with them\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-02 14:23** *Jourdan*: Disruptors is Meta’s high level rep program. You get access to new products, have a rep with more leverage to get things done, run hold out test etc. Kinda gave me the vibes we had on the google call. Not sure if we’re in a special program there but i was surprised at the knowledge and access to tools.  You do have to qualify from a spend perspective over a quarter and I can assume Sharma has some brands in the program
- **2025-07-02 14:23** *Jourdan*: I’ve worked with 2 brands in it and it was a good experience. I’ll ask the team in one of our chats
- **2025-07-02 14:25** *Ingrid*: can you ask Sharma to get us into the program?
- **2025-07-02 14:27** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am for sure
- **2025-07-02 15:26** *Ingrid*: hey let me know when you're off with Bark
- **2025-07-02 15:26** *Ingrid*: I have more questions about these spreadsheet inputs
- **2025-07-02 15:27** *Jourdan*: I’m off call with them. Pretty useful platform to help navigate which products to put more creative and paid resources behind based on profit per view 
- **2025-07-02 15:27** *Jourdan*: Free for questions 
- **2025-07-02 15:29** *Ingrid*: ok cool - calling you now

- **2025-07-03 15:11** *Ingrid*: can you look back on June 2024 Meta to see what rev it delivered?
- **2025-07-03 15:11** *Ingrid*: this number for june 2024 feels off

- **2025-07-03 15:26** *Ingrid*: soooo weird
- **2025-07-03 15:27** *Ingrid*: Chris in his tracker has $227k in meta spend
- **2025-07-03 15:27** *Jourdan*: Meta + affiliate?
- **2025-07-03 15:27** *Ingrid*: just meta
- **2025-07-03 15:28** *Ingrid*: ill connect w him on it
- **2025-07-03 15:28** *Ingrid*: thank you
- **2025-07-03 15:30** *Jourdan*: Hmm ok ok it might include other channels since it’s paid social. I can check other channels for that time too
- **2025-07-03 15:32** *Ingrid*: he has it broken out as just meta - it's ok dont spin your wheels on this one
- **2025-07-03 15:32** *Ingrid*: i had a good long chat with Ari about changing all our campaigns to product funnels
- **2025-07-03 15:33** *Ingrid*: she is fully onboard and we can revisit on monday when we all chat
- **2025-07-03 15:34** *Jourdan*: Okay sweet, I followed up with Jake and he echoed that. They’ll kick it off next week he just wanted to align with SB team
- **2025-07-03 15:34** *Ingrid*: perf
- **2025-07-03 15:34** *Ingrid*: thank you! yea - we'll then need to adjust all our reporting and KPIS, yay
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Jourdan*: Didn’t want to kick anything new off over 4th of July weekend. Would be nice to have produce specific goals too 
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Ingrid*: maybe take a stab at a new way to track all that - I'm still going to track the total business like we are doing, but on a daily/weekly we need to have Sharma report differently on pacing and performance
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Ingrid*: ha same minds
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Jourdan*: Yesss lol it’ll make narrowing down to needle movers much easier 
- **2025-07-03 15:36** *Ingrid*: I'm going to work on a doc for how I am thinking about seperating
- **2025-07-03 15:36** *Ingrid*: and then share with you
- **2025-07-03 15:42** *Ingrid*: will also give us a clean way to create a funnel for the full size sauna
- **2025-07-03 15:42** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good! Do we have any sales resources to take phone calls to sell that?
- **2025-07-07 14:50** *Ingrid*: Hey - I may be a few minutes late to the 1pm with Sharma - go ahead without me and I’ll call you after 
- **2025-07-07 14:50** *Ingrid*: Mainly want to make sure we are on track with the reconfiguration of the product funnels 
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good. Google performance looks solid with increase MTD but getting concenred about Meta CAC mtd. L7 looks okay but its ballooned and ill get an update on single product camps
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Ingrid*: I’m just at the dr and he is running late 
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Jourdan*: Okkkk! I hope everything is okay
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Ingrid*: Oh yea just a checkup 
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Jourdan*: Sounds good! Talk to you in a bit
- **2025-07-07 14:52** *Ingrid*: Also gentle reminder to do you performance marketing and DTC summary today
- **2025-07-07 14:52** *Jourdan*: Yesss ma’am saw the update come through (From Elyse) and have my calendar event\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-07 14:52** *Ingrid*: I’ll setup a weekly for us at 11am Mondays to review everything starting next week
- **2025-07-07 15:29** *Jourdan*: Call wrapped just some quick notes until we chat.  
  
• Campaigns shifted to single product by Wed EOD   
    ◦ Killing Legacy Campaigns (Holding Us Back)  
• Using Product Sets vs All Products in Meta Catalogs  
    ◦ Issue popped up w/ a bundle being served on IG that’s not avail on website.   
    ◦ Solution 1: Turn off product in Catalog so it doesn’t serve in Feed  
    ◦ Solution 2: Change in Shopify so there’s no chance of Shopify settings overruling Meta settings and showing the product as avail   
    ◦ Solution 3: Use Custom Product sets in Ads Manager featuring the Core 4. Could help w/ AOV and only serve DPA ads to high quality audiences which could lift performance on catalog campaigns.   
    ◦ I vote for Solution 2 and 3. SB doesn’t have ability to change on their end so this will need to be an internal update.   
• We’ve got a lot creative for PEMF and Sauna Blanket and some for Red Light Mask but could use more and not enough for Hat. Laura agreed to increase briefs for Hat &amp; Mask this week to be ready for Friday’s call. \n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-07 15:32** *Ingrid*: Agree - I like solution 3
- **2025-07-08 00:11** *Jourdan*: Here’s the written weekly report [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?usp=sharing)
- **2025-07-08 00:11** *Jourdan*: Elyse’s doc was updated earlier today
- **2025-07-08 00:12** *Jourdan*: I can include screenshots from Bark AI as those are inline with some of the images the previous GS provided
- **2025-07-08 09:59** *Jourdan*: If we’re not serving YT primarily then we may need to run some exclusions if possible. Not sure how i feel about these ads serving in Gmail and being effective
- **2025-07-08 10:00** *Jourdan*: Reminds me of an audience network placement on meta
- **2025-07-08 10:06** *Ingrid*: yea agree - bring it up on the google call?
- **2025-07-08 10:06** *Ingrid*: def chase jeremy
- **2025-07-08 10:07** *Ingrid*: thanks for staying on top of that - reviewing your summary now!
- **2025-07-08 10:08** *Jourdan*: You’re welcome! I just reached out to him. TT is the bad apple and if we can’t get it right i rather pull spend down and reallocate to AWIN or Google\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-08 10:08** *Jourdan*: AWIN looks juiiiiccyy with 35% increase in spend\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-08 10:25** *Ingrid*: yea we gave that channel the july 4th deal that only existed for affiliates!
- **2025-07-09 11:08** *Ingrid*: this would be compared to MNTN obviously
- **2025-07-09 11:09** *Ingrid*: need to evaluate which is better
- **2025-07-09 11:09** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am we’re on same page\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-09 11:09** *Jourdan*: Would be good to ask creative questions while we have them too\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-09 11:19** *Ingrid*: this is cool bc it's affilaite/sales based
- **2025-07-09 11:19** *Jourdan*: Could run both MNTN and this with them having two different goals
- **2025-07-09 11:20** *Jourdan*: Just curious what kind of offers they run on these channels w/ promos and QRs not being super effecitve
- **2025-07-09 11:21** *Ingrid*: yea, i guess my worry would be running them at the same time would inflate impact on both
- **2025-07-09 11:21** *Jourdan*: Yeah attribution could get muddy here since there’s no last touch
- **2025-07-09 11:22** *Ingrid*: word - let's pick one to start with then add the other
- **2025-07-09 11:22** *Ingrid*: let me know which you think is best to start
- **2025-07-09 11:23** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good. I’m 50/50 because there’s a lot of learnings to leverage from affiliates
- **2025-07-09 11:26** *Ingrid*: let's see what an adequest test budget would be
- **2025-07-09 11:26** *Ingrid*: we know MNTN is like 10-15k
- **2025-07-09 11:27** *Ingrid*: adequate*
- **2025-07-09 11:27** *Ingrid*: ah 15k
- **2025-07-09 11:28** *Jourdan*: Seems like we might get more bang for a buck with the $15k spent
- **2025-07-09 11:28** *Ingrid*: can you send the answers to these questions to her once she sends?
- **2025-07-09 11:29** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am
- **2025-07-09 13:39** *Jourdan*: Hey, just to keep you updated. Talked to Rahul  & Tori about scaling Google and adjusting T ROAS.  
  
We’re going to adjust T ROAS (15% Recommended by Google Rep) first. Continue w/ budget scale test for 30 days which ends 6.19.  
  
However a few campaigns aren’t scaling incrementally so we’ll make a judgement call on 6.19 to reduce spend.
- **2025-07-09 13:41** *Jourdan*: My thoughts… We push Google &amp; AWIN making Google our primary channel for spend while reducing dependency on Meta until we can meet a sub $800 CAC (1d, 1st time) KPI there. Already seeing this happen L30 with Google taking 35% of spend vs 31% on Meta. Ultimately we gotta get Meta more efficient so we don’t stress Google to hard and blow up CAC there’s a balance we need
- **2025-07-09 13:48** *Ingrid*: fully aligned and really appreciate the input and judgement call\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Jourdan*
- **2025-07-10 16:31** *Ingrid*: hey slack me if you need me on the call now
- **2025-07-10 16:31** *Ingrid*: i need to wrap up a few things and have already heard their thing
- **2025-07-10 16:31** *Ingrid*: im here just heads down
- **2025-07-10 16:33** *Jourdan*: Okay yeah no worries
- **2025-07-10 17:07** *Ingrid*: how did it go?
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: Still speaking with her but good so far
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: like the placement options they have
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: DOOH offering is pretty cool too
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: the others didn’t offer
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: Just wrapped
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: Starting recommended budget is a lot higher than the others but they also manage for us
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: $100-150k for 3 months
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: told her to come back with something in the 50-60k for 3 months
- **2025-07-10 17:22** *Jourdan*: They also mentioned canvases that surround the video creative featuring quotes and QR codes
- **2025-07-10 17:23** *Jourdan*: Liked that aspect because gives us the ability to incorporate messaging and give people option to visit website directly but after speaking with TV Scientific doesn’t seem that those are super effective
- **2025-07-10 17:23** *Jourdan*: she mentioned 30s videos as being most successful on their placements so gives a little more time for QR codes but still not that much
- **2025-07-10 17:31** *Ingrid*: ok yea, i def think they are too expensive for us and I'd suggest we start with the other 2
- **2025-07-10 17:31** *Ingrid*: how are our new campaigns doing this week
- **2025-07-10 17:33** *Ingrid*: also, loved your weekly one-pager. can you make one for YTD/H1?
- **2025-07-10 17:33** *Ingrid*: really want your analysis on how the year has been - what's been good, what needs to change, how we prep for H2
- **2025-07-10 17:39** *Ingrid*: i just left a few comments here for you too
- **2025-07-10 17:39** *Ingrid*: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?tab=t.0)\n\n📎 **GS | Weekly Report | 7.7.25** (gdoc, 133.2KB) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?tab=t.0)
- **2025-07-10 17:39** *Jourdan*: Okay yes i can work on the H1 breakdown\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-10 17:43** *Jourdan*: and we’re on day 2 so not a lot of data.  
  
However Red Light Hat is strongest campaign based on in platform data with 2.83 ROAS and $780 AOV  
Red Light Mask has one purchase a .50 ROAS  
PEMF Mat has one conversion at .9 ROAS  
Sauna Blanket has one conversion  at .08 ROAS but low AOV ($70) so i think it tracked a conversion from a different product
- **2025-07-10 17:43** *Jourdan*: $750/day budget across each of those campaigns
- **2025-07-10 17:45** *Jourdan*: I’d give til end of day 3 to assess
- **2025-07-10 17:54** *Ingrid*: ok cool - i LOVE having this level of product data
- **2025-07-10 17:55** *Ingrid*: let's try to move the needle on our YoY growth, down 6% is bad
- **2025-07-10 17:55** *Ingrid*: can you dig in and see where the bleeding is?
- **2025-07-10 18:09** *Jourdan*: Surface level, I’m sure you see this too but CVR is down 52%, AOV down 13%, and Return customer down 10%  although sessions are up 132%. Also seeing discounts higher ($52.7k) this month than last year ($38.7k).  [Discounts](https://admin.shopify.com/store/higherdose/analytics/reports/total*sales*by*product?ql=FROM+sales%0A++SHOW+net*items*sold%2C+gross*sales%2C+discounts%2C+returns%2C+net*sales%2C+taxes%2C%0A++++total*sales%0A++WHERE+product*title+IS+NOT+NULL%0A++GROUP+BY+product*title%2C+product*vendor%2C+product*type+WITH+TOTALS%2C%0A++++PERCENT*CHANGE%0A++SINCE+startOfMonth%280m%29+UNTIL+today%0A++COMPARE+TO+previous*year%0A++ORDER+BY+total*sales+DESC%0A++LIMIT+1000%0AVISUALIZE+total*sales+TYPE+horizontal_bar) doesn’t make sense since we didn’t have 4th of July sale.  
  
Sessions alone could explain CVR since we’re sending more traffic  
  
Sauna Blanket down 32% in Sales Rev but the Kit is up 26% so discrepancy isn’t that large.  
PEMF Pro Mat down 58%  
  
Silver lining, Body Sculptor has 32k in rev which makes up for some of the downtrends from existing products.
- **2025-07-10 18:16** *Jourdan*: How do we correct, push harder on Red Light Hat. Seems to be the most efficient product w/ paid media. This could improve Meta performance and drive more rev. However we need to improve Sauna Blanket and PEMF Mat paid media performance. Could be a creative solution or produce new landing page assets for those products.
- **2025-07-10 18:34** *Ingrid*: Can you please align with Laura for that creative brief due tomorrow
- **2025-07-10 18:34** *Ingrid*: Let’s include everything we need to push these softer comp products 
- **2025-07-10 18:34** *Ingrid*: She said you never go back to her?
- **2025-07-10 18:37** *Jourdan*: Looks like she tagged me in the brief last night (Im CST right now) but I just got back to her with a reply and added in Red Light Hat to her product mix\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-10 18:38** *Jourdan*: From what Jake shared we’ve got more Blanket and PEMF creative than Red Light
- **2025-07-10 18:38** *Jourdan*: however with sales being down we still need resources here to improve efficiency
- **2025-07-10 18:39** *Jourdan* 💬 10 replies: Do we want to focus on the Red Light Neck Enhancer?
- **2025-07-10 19:02** *Jourdan*: What products should we focus on for CTV? I know Core 4 for sure but are there any others we should include?
- **2025-07-10 19:03** *Jourdan*: Laura brought up Full Spectrum Sauna and mentioned Lauren has interest mixing topicals into our efforts  :eyes:
- **2025-07-10 20:12** *Ingrid*: I’d start with lifestyle and core 4 to start, it’s a good intro to the brand 
- **2025-07-10 20:12** *Ingrid*: Then we can add full size and topicals once we prove out the channel on the basics 
- **2025-07-10 20:13** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good
- **2025-07-10 20:13** *Jourdan*: thank you
- **2025-07-10 20:17** *Jourdan*: Okay any interest in Endorphin oil + sweat band, trans mag spray, and press?  
  
These are lower AOV so i assume keeping it to Red Light, PEMF, and SB to get us back on track would be ideal?
- **2025-07-11 17:06** *Ingrid*: Appreciate you being on top of sharma on those campaigns!
- **2025-07-11 17:10** *Jourdan*: Of course! I want to get this thing turned around asap. Meta can be a lot better which will lift the entire ecosystem and make rev targets at efficiency a bit easier. Seeing these segmented by product is so valuable! Thank you for being behind that push as well\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-11 17:23** *Ingrid*: Yes getting meta right will do soooo much 
- **2025-07-11 17:23** *Ingrid*: Go team 
- **2025-07-14 13:03** *Ingrid*: 2 min!
- **2025-07-14 13:06** *Ingrid*: here!
- **2025-07-14 13:06** *Jourdan*: had to run to bathroom
- **2025-07-14 13:06** *Jourdan*: be there in a sec
- **2025-07-14 13:07** *Jourdan*: @Ingrid

- **2025-07-14 13:39** *Jourdan*: Last question, are we looking at gross sales or net when looking at YOY?
- **2025-07-14 13:39** *Ingrid*: Net as it’s in Shopify 
- **2025-07-14 13:39** *Ingrid*: Sales after returns and discounts 
- **2025-07-14 13:43** *Jourdan*: Okay net is showing down 3%. It does look like we’ve got a good bit less of discount rev this year compared to last year but returns are up a lot.  
  
I’d expect net to be up YoY but returns make up the money saved with less discount rev.\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-07-14 at 13.38.39.png** (png, 136.7KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F095T0L78TE/screenshot_2025-07-14_at_13.38.39.png)
- **2025-07-14 13:44** *Ingrid*: It’s all solvable with more top line sales
- **2025-07-14 13:44** *Ingrid*: We need more cushion there 
- **2025-07-14 13:45** *Jourdan*: Yeah agreed
- **2025-07-14 13:46** *Jourdan*: we’ve got like a 4 day buffer before Google recommends we bump budgets again. Speaking with Anastasia now on increasing\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-14 13:48** *Ingrid*: Ok cool. I’m going to skip the 1pm sharma call but I’d like you to join and tell them what we jsut discussed (the sales gap, the wanting new top of funnel drivers) and let me know what they say. I’ll be on the tomorrow morning call though of course 
- **2025-07-14 13:48** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good
- **2025-07-15 09:34** *Ingrid*: hey jourdan are you joining this sharma call?
- **2025-07-15 10:48** *Jourdan*: Hey @Ingrid My mom fell this morning and opened her incision so I’ve been on the phone with her ortho’s office figuring out what to do. I’m sorry for the late heads up I’m just a little overwhelmed 
- **2025-07-15 11:14** *Ingrid*: Oh, man I really hope she is ok and I'm glad you're there to help her. Thanks so much for the heads up, I was super concerned!
- **2025-07-15 11:22** *Jourdan*: I think she will be just in a lot of pain. Thankfully her ortho reassured me and we’ll be able to get her to urgent care today so they can close it back up since it was glued. I’ll follow up with Sharma i see they reached out to lock in CAC
- **2025-07-15 11:59** *Ingrid*: ok, glad there is a plan to get her to a better place
- **2025-07-16 13:33** *Jourdan*: Hey I got back to your email and followed up with meta team but they’re in Tel Aviv.   
  
Your mornings next week are a little full but checking to see if you have flexibility for anything morning cst/est after Mon &amp; Tue?
- **2025-07-16 13:57** *Ingrid*: Ah, I'm actually out Mon/Tues next week but I think you and Sharma to should meet them anyway (without me)
- **2025-07-16 13:57** *Ingrid*: so go ahead and book what works for everyone else
- **2025-07-16 14:01** *Jourdan*: Okay I saw you were OOO so sent times that worked with with your schedule but seems like mornings are best for everyone so I’ll follow up with them. \n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*

- **2025-07-16 14:02** *Jourdan*: So I’ll send a message out in a bit to coordinate. Would you want to be on that call? 
- **2025-07-16 14:03** *Ingrid*: the bark or meta call?
- **2025-07-16 14:03** *Ingrid*: i dont need to be on either - good to have you start leading those

- **2025-07-17 11:23** *Ingrid*: hey - are you on this call? i see you on but when i asked you aquestion there was no answer
- **2025-07-17 11:40** *Jourdan*: Yes i was but stepped away to the bathroom so missed that question. Here’s my notes from the convo  
  
**Action Items / Takeaways**  
• Sharma to **move forward with creative concept** focused on starter kits for younger kids.  
• Test **talking head format** with VO as preferred option.  
• Clarify **usage rights** on existing UGC content.  
• Identify assets that align with Ingrid’s vision of **elevated lifestyle and rituals**.  
• Ensure collaboration and **emotional clarity** among key stakeholders to reduce friction.  

- **2025-07-17 11:42** *Ingrid*: Can you please call me?

- **2025-07-17 13:06** *Jourdan*: Hey, im following up with Gui and need clarity around % of revenue  
  
“What percentage of your revenue comes from D2C, retail, and marketplace”  
  
W/ 36M on Shopify last 12 months I’m assuming retail and marketplace accounts are tracked off platform?  
Is it safe to say those 2 make up 20% of the total rev?\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-17 13:39** *Ingrid*: yes, 85% DTC
- **2025-07-17 13:39** *Ingrid*: rest retail/marketplace

- **2025-07-24 10:50** *Ingrid*: im open to it if we are very good about our segmentations and not blasting everyone everyday
- **2025-07-24 10:55** *Jourdan*: Yeah for sure it would have to be something we work up to so people are used to the cadence and we’ll have to be driving enough new subscribers 
- **2025-07-24 10:55** *Jourdan*: Wanted to run it by you before I push for it with Elyse and Sharma. I know Elyse has a few bigger projects she’s working on 
- **2025-07-24 11:02** *Ingrid*: yea, they are very good at taking strategy suggestions and working on testings, etc, im cool with you getting more involved and asking those questions/making suggestions

- **2025-07-25 12:38** *Ingrid*: no apologies needed!

- **2025-07-25 13:43** *Ingrid*: damn, Meta looks SO BAD in this H1 review
- **2025-07-25 14:38** *Jourdan*: Yes i can get that done and Meta’s total impact is hard to measure with the conservative views we use but performance is down YoY . All paid social channels look rough compared to Google &amp; Affiliate but I think those channels are influenced by paid social. Hopefully Prescient sheds a lot of light on this in the coming months
- **2025-07-25 14:39** *Ingrid*: Yea, agree. Also now that you’re here we can right the ship on meta!
- **2025-07-25 14:42** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am! We’ll get it going in the right direction. I’ll give it a couple more weeks but I think we narrow it down to 2 products on Meta and test the new products as they come. Sauna Blanket &amp; PEMF are roughhhh now that we’ve broken things out by product

- **2025-06-25 11:12** *Ingrid*: I also want to make sure you're able to join that Decile call today at 1pm, would love you to own that data and relationship, I think it's powerful and I never had the time to unlock it properly
- **2025-06-25 11:12** *Ingrid*: sorry at 10am
- **2025-06-25 11:12** *Ingrid*: our time
- **2025-06-25 11:13** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am I’ll be on call for Decile and sounds good on Amazon

- **2025-06-25 11:13** *Jourdan*: Okay no worries 
- **2025-06-25 13:02** *Jourdan*: Prescient is legit and I think we should add it
- **2025-06-25 13:03** *Ingrid*: word, i knew you would like it
- **2025-06-25 13:03** *Jourdan*: Decile had a lot of interesting insights around customer data. Perfect tool to use for figuring out Paid Hero products and which lead to higher LTV
- **2025-06-25 13:03** *Jourdan*: The highdration kit was not on my radar at all
- **2025-06-25 13:03** *Ingrid*: yes! ok yea def dig into how we operationalize the decile data
- **2025-06-25 13:04** *Ingrid*: the highdraytion powder is gross imo
- **2025-06-25 13:04** *Ingrid*: we need a new formulation lol
- **2025-06-25 13:05** *Jourdan*: I think most have been given away for free at this point.  22% customer share ratio and and crazy 1st time rev so i feel like people we’re buying other products and this was a free gift + purchase item\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-25 at 11.04.43.png** (png, 190.7KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F093FM9AAKB/screenshot_2025-06-25_at_11.04.43.png)

- **2025-06-27 10:41** *Ingrid*: Morning! this is what Chris sent over last night\n\n📎 **Data.xlsx** (xlsx, 58.3KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F093F60QYKE/data.xlsx)
- **2025-06-27 10:42** *Ingrid*: let me know if it's missing anything you may need or is difference from the data you're seeing in platform (good to double check)
- **2025-06-30 11:20** *Ingrid*: morning!
- **2025-06-30 11:20** *Jourdan*: Good morning!
- **2025-06-30 11:20** *Ingrid*: I jsut added you to the Pinterest call at 930, i didnt realize you were ont it
- **2025-06-30 11:21** *Jourdan*: Might be 5 mins late but can make it!
- **2025-06-30 11:21** *Ingrid*: cool no prob
- **2025-06-30 11:39** *Jourdan*: So iffy on pinterest platform reporting but thats based in bias on previous experiences. Im open to exploring here just need reporting based on in platform 1 day attribution to make decisions
- **2025-06-30 11:52** *Ingrid*: word
- **2025-06-30 11:52** *Ingrid*: i think both you and Berkeley are on the same page there
- **2025-06-30 15:50** *Ingrid*: hey hey how are you coming along with that marketing budget input porject?
- **2025-06-30 15:51** *Ingrid*: id love to also see all of Chris' actualized numbers in there that he sent last week
- **2025-06-30 17:39** *Jourdan*: Q1-Q4 Summaries are all up to date with historical data\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Ingrid*
- **2025-06-30 17:39** *Jourdan*: working on individual months now
- **2025-06-30 17:42** *Jourdan*: Is the 1.6 m on $350k in spend is for all paid channels and is that Shopify Rev only?
- **2025-06-30 17:43** *Jourdan*: Basically should i update sales goal on july tab to 1.6 m because i see spend is at $350k
- **2025-06-30 20:49** *Ingrid*: Well let’s discuss it and align to a reasonable but but stretch goal to get everyone focused 
- **2025-06-30 20:50** *Ingrid*: I’ll review the doc tomorrow and then we can catch about H2 budgets and goals to make sure we are tracking to where we need to be on both spend and sales 
- **2025-06-30 20:52** *Jourdan*: Okay awesome I’ll work on individual months so we have some starting projections to work with 
- **2025-06-30 20:52** *Ingrid*: Perfect, thank you!
- **2025-07-01 09:35** *Ingrid*: hey jourdan are you joining the sharma call?
- **2025-07-01 10:39** *Ingrid*: hey, I don't see the media and performance summary in the weekly deck yet and it's due each monday EOD - how can I help make sure this is complete?
- **2025-07-01 11:35** *Jourdan*: Ahh so sorry that slipped my mind yesterday. I’ll create a reminder on my calendar to complete EOD. I’ll start updating it now \n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-01 11:45** *Jourdan*: I see its been completed, I’ll keep this same format for next week. I changed it last week and there’s a handful of new metrics that people may not be familiar with
- **2025-07-01 11:56** *Ingrid*: ok great - can you do one that is H1 now that it's over?
- **2025-07-01 11:57** *Jourdan*: So DTC performance recap from Jan to June right?
- **2025-07-01 12:00** *Ingrid*: Yes please 
- **2025-07-01 13:17** *Jourdan*: Updated Summaries with projections
- **2025-07-01 13:17** *Jourdan*: Used previous years growth and applied to sales and spend to get 2025 projections
- **2025-07-01 13:18** *Jourdan*: I left a formula key but if it doesn’t make sense let me know
- **2025-07-01 13:18** *Jourdan*: I could also project based on avg growth since 2023
- **2025-07-01 13:19** *Jourdan*: Also updated the YTD table to give data up until the quarter we’re viewing. So Q3 doesn’t include Q4  and Q2 doesn’t include Q3
- **2025-07-01 13:21** *Jourdan*: and added an efficiency column so we can track total return. I think these numbers will need to be played with a bit because efficiency takes a hit if we model it after last years growth
- **2025-07-01 13:21** *Ingrid*: yea def need to adjsut these a lot
- **2025-07-01 13:22** *Ingrid*: the goal I have for total 2025 is 20% Growth	22%	5%	$8,307,513	$37,083,320

- **2025-07-01 13:22** *Ingrid*: yours is on top and my goal are on bottom
- **2025-07-01 13:23** *Ingrid*: with the highlighted being the key goal
- **2025-07-01 13:24** *Ingrid*: the previous years data is all over the place so not the best guideline
- **2025-07-01 13:24** *Jourdan*: Okay cool cool adjusting now
- **2025-07-01 13:24** *Ingrid*: thank you!
- **2025-07-01 13:24** *Jourdan*: You’re welcome
- **2025-07-01 19:57** *Jourdan*: Made those updates. Spend in Q1 Summary didn’t reflect Affiliate spend so i updated that. If you check Q4 summary the totals are inline with your projections
- **2025-07-01 19:57** *Jourdan*: We just have to get super efficient the remainder of the year
- **2025-07-01 20:00** *Jourdan*: Moving to EOM and H1 reports 
- **2025-07-02 14:05** *Jourdan*: Are you familiar with the disruptors program at Meta?
- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Ingrid*: hi! im not - but tell me about it!
- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Ingrid*: also - i need to skip the call with Bark, which is fine bc it's. good for you to meet them anyway and have them walk you through the platform
- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Ingrid*: i need to do amazon stuff with chris
- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Jourdan*: Okay no worries! I’ll get up to speed with them\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-02 14:23** *Jourdan*: Disruptors is Meta’s high level rep program. You get access to new products, have a rep with more leverage to get things done, run hold out test etc. Kinda gave me the vibes we had on the google call. Not sure if we’re in a special program there but i was surprised at the knowledge and access to tools.  You do have to qualify from a spend perspective over a quarter and I can assume Sharma has some brands in the program
- **2025-07-02 14:23** *Jourdan*: I’ve worked with 2 brands in it and it was a good experience. I’ll ask the team in one of our chats
- **2025-07-02 14:25** *Ingrid*: can you ask Sharma to get us into the program?
- **2025-07-02 14:27** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am for sure
- **2025-07-02 15:26** *Ingrid*: hey let me know when you're off with Bark
- **2025-07-02 15:26** *Ingrid*: I have more questions about these spreadsheet inputs
- **2025-07-02 15:27** *Jourdan*: I’m off call with them. Pretty useful platform to help navigate which products to put more creative and paid resources behind based on profit per view 
- **2025-07-02 15:27** *Jourdan*: Free for questions 
- **2025-07-02 15:29** *Ingrid*: ok cool - calling you now

- **2025-07-03 15:27** *Ingrid*: Chris in his tracker has $227k in meta spend
- **2025-07-03 15:27** *Jourdan*: Meta + affiliate?
- **2025-07-03 15:27** *Ingrid*: just meta
- **2025-07-03 15:28** *Ingrid*: ill connect w him on it
- **2025-07-03 15:28** *Ingrid*: thank you
- **2025-07-03 15:30** *Jourdan*: Hmm ok ok it might include other channels since it’s paid social. I can check other channels for that time too
- **2025-07-03 15:32** *Ingrid*: he has it broken out as just meta - it's ok dont spin your wheels on this one
- **2025-07-03 15:32** *Ingrid*: i had a good long chat with Ari about changing all our campaigns to product funnels
- **2025-07-03 15:33** *Ingrid*: she is fully onboard and we can revisit on monday when we all chat
- **2025-07-03 15:34** *Jourdan*: Okay sweet, I followed up with Jake and he echoed that. They’ll kick it off next week he just wanted to align with SB team
- **2025-07-03 15:34** *Ingrid*: perf
- **2025-07-03 15:34** *Ingrid*: thank you! yea - we'll then need to adjust all our reporting and KPIS, yay
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Jourdan*: Didn’t want to kick anything new off over 4th of July weekend. Would be nice to have produce specific goals too 
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Ingrid*: maybe take a stab at a new way to track all that - I'm still going to track the total business like we are doing, but on a daily/weekly we need to have Sharma report differently on pacing and performance
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Ingrid*: ha same minds
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Jourdan*: Yesss lol it’ll make narrowing down to needle movers much easier 
- **2025-07-03 15:36** *Ingrid*: I'm going to work on a doc for how I am thinking about seperating
- **2025-07-03 15:36** *Ingrid*: and then share with you
- **2025-07-03 15:42** *Ingrid*: will also give us a clean way to create a funnel for the full size sauna
- **2025-07-03 15:42** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good! Do we have any sales resources to take phone calls to sell that?
- **2025-07-07 14:50** *Ingrid*: Hey - I may be a few minutes late to the 1pm with Sharma - go ahead without me and I’ll call you after 
- **2025-07-07 14:50** *Ingrid*: Mainly want to make sure we are on track with the reconfiguration of the product funnels 
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good. Google performance looks solid with increase MTD but getting concenred about Meta CAC mtd. L7 looks okay but its ballooned and ill get an update on single product camps
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Ingrid*: I’m just at the dr and he is running late 
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Jourdan*: Okkkk! I hope everything is okay
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Ingrid*: Oh yea just a checkup 
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Jourdan*: Sounds good! Talk to you in a bit

- **2025-07-07 15:29** *Jourdan*: Call wrapped just some quick notes until we chat.  
  
• Campaigns shifted to single product by Wed EOD   
    ◦ Killing Legacy Campaigns (Holding Us Back)  
• Using Product Sets vs All Products in Meta Catalogs  
    ◦ Issue popped up w/ a bundle being served on IG that’s not avail on website.   
    ◦ Solution 1: Turn off product in Catalog so it doesn’t serve in Feed  
    ◦ Solution 2: Change in Shopify so there’s no chance of Shopify settings overruling Meta settings and showing the product as avail   
    ◦ Solution 3: Use Custom Product sets in Ads Manager featuring the Core 4. Could help w/ AOV and only serve DPA ads to high quality audiences which could lift performance on catalog campaigns.   
    ◦ I vote for Solution 2 and 3. SB doesn’t have ability to change on their end so this will need to be an internal update.   
• We’ve got a lot creative for PEMF and Sauna Blanket and some for Red Light Mask but could use more and not enough for Hat. Laura agreed to increase briefs for Hat &amp; Mask this week to be ready for Friday’s call. \n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-07 15:32** *Ingrid*: Agree - I like solution 3

- **2025-07-08 00:11** *Jourdan*: Elyse’s doc was updated earlier today
- **2025-07-08 00:12** *Jourdan*: I can include screenshots from Bark AI as those are inline with some of the images the previous GS provided
- **2025-07-08 09:59** *Jourdan*: If we’re not serving YT primarily then we may need to run some exclusions if possible. Not sure how i feel about these ads serving in Gmail and being effective
- **2025-07-08 10:00** *Jourdan*: Reminds me of an audience network placement on meta
- **2025-07-08 10:06** *Ingrid*: yea agree - bring it up on the google call?
- **2025-07-08 10:06** *Ingrid*: def chase jeremy
- **2025-07-08 10:07** *Ingrid*: thanks for staying on top of that - reviewing your summary now!
- **2025-07-08 10:08** *Jourdan*: You’re welcome! I just reached out to him. TT is the bad apple and if we can’t get it right i rather pull spend down and reallocate to AWIN or Google\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-08 10:08** *Jourdan*: AWIN looks juiiiiccyy with 35% increase in spend\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-08 10:25** *Ingrid*: yea we gave that channel the july 4th deal that only existed for affiliates!
- **2025-07-09 11:08** *Ingrid*: this would be compared to MNTN obviously
- **2025-07-09 11:09** *Ingrid*: need to evaluate which is better
- **2025-07-09 11:09** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am we’re on same page\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-09 11:09** *Jourdan*: Would be good to ask creative questions while we have them too\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-09 11:19** *Ingrid*: this is cool bc it's affilaite/sales based
- **2025-07-09 11:19** *Jourdan*: Could run both MNTN and this with them having two different goals
- **2025-07-09 11:20** *Jourdan*: Just curious what kind of offers they run on these channels w/ promos and QRs not being super effecitve
- **2025-07-09 11:21** *Ingrid*: yea, i guess my worry would be running them at the same time would inflate impact on both
- **2025-07-09 11:21** *Jourdan*: Yeah attribution could get muddy here since there’s no last touch
- **2025-07-09 11:22** *Ingrid*: word - let's pick one to start with then add the other
- **2025-07-09 11:22** *Ingrid*: let me know which you think is best to start
- **2025-07-09 11:23** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good. I’m 50/50 because there’s a lot of learnings to leverage from affiliates
- **2025-07-09 11:26** *Ingrid*: let's see what an adequest test budget would be
- **2025-07-09 11:26** *Ingrid*: we know MNTN is like 10-15k
- **2025-07-09 11:27** *Ingrid*: adequate*
- **2025-07-09 11:27** *Ingrid*: ah 15k
- **2025-07-09 11:28** *Jourdan*: Seems like we might get more bang for a buck with the $15k spent
- **2025-07-09 11:28** *Ingrid*: can you send the answers to these questions to her once she sends?
- **2025-07-09 11:29** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am
- **2025-07-09 13:39** *Jourdan*: Hey, just to keep you updated. Talked to Rahul  & Tori about scaling Google and adjusting T ROAS.  
  
We’re going to adjust T ROAS (15% Recommended by Google Rep) first. Continue w/ budget scale test for 30 days which ends 6.19.  
  
However a few campaigns aren’t scaling incrementally so we’ll make a judgement call on 6.19 to reduce spend.
- **2025-07-09 13:41** *Jourdan*: My thoughts… We push Google &amp; AWIN making Google our primary channel for spend while reducing dependency on Meta until we can meet a sub $800 CAC (1d, 1st time) KPI there. Already seeing this happen L30 with Google taking 35% of spend vs 31% on Meta. Ultimately we gotta get Meta more efficient so we don’t stress Google to hard and blow up CAC there’s a balance we need
- **2025-07-09 13:48** *Ingrid*: fully aligned and really appreciate the input and judgement call\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Jourdan*
- **2025-07-10 16:31** *Ingrid*: hey slack me if you need me on the call now
- **2025-07-10 16:31** *Ingrid*: i need to wrap up a few things and have already heard their thing
- **2025-07-10 16:31** *Ingrid*: im here just heads down
- **2025-07-10 16:33** *Jourdan*: Okay yeah no worries
- **2025-07-10 17:07** *Ingrid*: how did it go?
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: Still speaking with her but good so far
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: like the placement options they have
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: DOOH offering is pretty cool too
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: the others didn’t offer
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: Just wrapped
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: Starting recommended budget is a lot higher than the others but they also manage for us
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: $100-150k for 3 months
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: told her to come back with something in the 50-60k for 3 months
- **2025-07-10 17:22** *Jourdan*: They also mentioned canvases that surround the video creative featuring quotes and QR codes
- **2025-07-10 17:23** *Jourdan*: Liked that aspect because gives us the ability to incorporate messaging and give people option to visit website directly but after speaking with TV Scientific doesn’t seem that those are super effective
- **2025-07-10 17:23** *Jourdan*: she mentioned 30s videos as being most successful on their placements so gives a little more time for QR codes but still not that much
- **2025-07-10 17:31** *Ingrid*: ok yea, i def think they are too expensive for us and I'd suggest we start with the other 2
- **2025-07-10 17:31** *Ingrid*: how are our new campaigns doing this week
- **2025-07-10 17:33** *Ingrid*: also, loved your weekly one-pager. can you make one for YTD/H1?
- **2025-07-10 17:33** *Ingrid*: really want your analysis on how the year has been - what's been good, what needs to change, how we prep for H2
- **2025-07-10 17:39** *Ingrid*: i just left a few comments here for you too
- **2025-07-10 17:39** *Ingrid*: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?tab=t.0)\n\n📎 **GS | Weekly Report | 7.7.25** (gdoc, 133.2KB) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?tab=t.0)
- **2025-07-10 17:39** *Jourdan*: Okay yes i can work on the H1 breakdown\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-10 17:43** *Jourdan*: and we’re on day 2 so not a lot of data.  
  
However Red Light Hat is strongest campaign based on in platform data with 2.83 ROAS and $780 AOV  
Red Light Mask has one purchase a .50 ROAS  
PEMF Mat has one conversion at .9 ROAS  
Sauna Blanket has one conversion  at .08 ROAS but low AOV ($70) so i think it tracked a conversion from a different product
- **2025-07-10 17:43** *Jourdan*: $750/day budget across each of those campaigns
- **2025-07-10 17:45** *Jourdan*: I’d give til end of day 3 to assess
- **2025-07-10 17:54** *Ingrid*: ok cool - i LOVE having this level of product data
- **2025-07-10 17:55** *Ingrid*: let's try to move the needle on our YoY growth, down 6% is bad
- **2025-07-10 17:55** *Ingrid*: can you dig in and see where the bleeding is?
- **2025-07-10 18:09** *Jourdan*: Surface level, I’m sure you see this too but CVR is down 52%, AOV down 13%, and Return customer down 10%  although sessions are up 132%. Also seeing discounts higher ($52.7k) this month than last year ($38.7k).  [Discounts](https://admin.shopify.com/store/higherdose/analytics/reports/total*sales*by*product?ql=FROM+sales%0A++SHOW+net*items*sold%2C+gross*sales%2C+discounts%2C+returns%2C+net*sales%2C+taxes%2C%0A++++total*sales%0A++WHERE+product*title+IS+NOT+NULL%0A++GROUP+BY+product*title%2C+product*vendor%2C+product*type+WITH+TOTALS%2C%0A++++PERCENT*CHANGE%0A++SINCE+startOfMonth%280m%29+UNTIL+today%0A++COMPARE+TO+previous*year%0A++ORDER+BY+total*sales+DESC%0A++LIMIT+1000%0AVISUALIZE+total*sales+TYPE+horizontal_bar) doesn’t make sense since we didn’t have 4th of July sale.  
  
Sessions alone could explain CVR since we’re sending more traffic  
  
Sauna Blanket down 32% in Sales Rev but the Kit is up 26% so discrepancy isn’t that large.  
PEMF Pro Mat down 58%  
  
Silver lining, Body Sculptor has 32k in rev which makes up for some of the downtrends from existing products.
- **2025-07-10 18:16** *Jourdan*: How do we correct, push harder on Red Light Hat. Seems to be the most efficient product w/ paid media. This could improve Meta performance and drive more rev. However we need to improve Sauna Blanket and PEMF Mat paid media performance. Could be a creative solution or produce new landing page assets for those products.
- **2025-07-10 18:34** *Ingrid*: Can you please align with Laura for that creative brief due tomorrow
- **2025-07-10 18:34** *Ingrid*: Let’s include everything we need to push these softer comp products 
- **2025-07-10 18:34** *Ingrid*: She said you never go back to her?
- **2025-07-10 18:37** *Jourdan*: Looks like she tagged me in the brief last night (Im CST right now) but I just got back to her with a reply and added in Red Light Hat to her product mix\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-10 18:38** *Jourdan*: From what Jake shared we’ve got more Blanket and PEMF creative than Red Light
- **2025-07-10 18:38** *Jourdan*: however with sales being down we still need resources here to improve efficiency
- **2025-07-10 18:39** *Jourdan* 💬 10 replies: Do we want to focus on the Red Light Neck Enhancer?
- **2025-07-10 19:02** *Jourdan*: What products should we focus on for CTV? I know Core 4 for sure but are there any others we should include?
- **2025-07-10 19:03** *Jourdan*: Laura brought up Full Spectrum Sauna and mentioned Lauren has interest mixing topicals into our efforts  :eyes:
- **2025-07-10 20:12** *Ingrid*: I’d start with lifestyle and core 4 to start, it’s a good intro to the brand 
- **2025-07-10 20:12** *Ingrid*: Then we can add full size and topicals once we prove out the channel on the basics 
- **2025-07-10 20:13** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good
- **2025-07-10 20:13** *Jourdan*: thank you
- **2025-07-10 20:17** *Jourdan*: Okay any interest in Endorphin oil + sweat band, trans mag spray, and press?  
  
These are lower AOV so i assume keeping it to Red Light, PEMF, and SB to get us back on track would be ideal?
- **2025-07-11 17:06** *Ingrid*: Appreciate you being on top of sharma on those campaigns!
- **2025-07-11 17:10** *Jourdan*: Of course! I want to get this thing turned around asap. Meta can be a lot better which will lift the entire ecosystem and make rev targets at efficiency a bit easier. Seeing these segmented by product is so valuable! Thank you for being behind that push as well\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-11 17:23** *Ingrid*: Yes getting meta right will do soooo much 
- **2025-07-11 17:23** *Ingrid*: Go team 
- **2025-07-14 13:03** *Ingrid*: 2 min!
- **2025-07-14 13:06** *Ingrid*: here!

- **2025-07-14 13:39** *Jourdan*: Last question, are we looking at gross sales or net when looking at YOY?
- **2025-07-14 13:39** *Ingrid*: Net as it’s in Shopify 
- **2025-07-14 13:39** *Ingrid*: Sales after returns and discounts 
- **2025-07-14 13:43** *Jourdan*: Okay net is showing down 3%. It does look like we’ve got a good bit less of discount rev this year compared to last year but returns are up a lot.  
  
I’d expect net to be up YoY but returns make up the money saved with less discount rev.\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-07-14 at 13.38.39.png** (png, 136.7KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F095T0L78TE/screenshot_2025-07-14_at_13.38.39.png)
- **2025-07-14 13:44** *Ingrid*: It’s all solvable with more top line sales
- **2025-07-14 13:44** *Ingrid*: We need more cushion there 
- **2025-07-14 13:45** *Jourdan*: Yeah agreed
- **2025-07-14 13:46** *Jourdan*: we’ve got like a 4 day buffer before Google recommends we bump budgets again. Speaking with Anastasia now on increasing\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-14 13:48** *Ingrid*: Ok cool. I’m going to skip the 1pm sharma call but I’d like you to join and tell them what we jsut discussed (the sales gap, the wanting new top of funnel drivers) and let me know what they say. I’ll be on the tomorrow morning call though of course 
- **2025-07-14 13:48** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good
- **2025-07-15 09:34** *Ingrid*: hey jourdan are you joining this sharma call?
- **2025-07-15 10:48** *Jourdan*: Hey @Ingrid My mom fell this morning and opened her incision so I’ve been on the phone with her ortho’s office figuring out what to do. I’m sorry for the late heads up I’m just a little overwhelmed 
- **2025-07-15 11:14** *Ingrid*: Oh, man I really hope she is ok and I'm glad you're there to help her. Thanks so much for the heads up, I was super concerned!
- **2025-07-15 11:22** *Jourdan*: I think she will be just in a lot of pain. Thankfully her ortho reassured me and we’ll be able to get her to urgent care today so they can close it back up since it was glued. I’ll follow up with Sharma i see they reached out to lock in CAC
- **2025-07-15 11:59** *Ingrid*: ok, glad there is a plan to get her to a better place
- **2025-07-16 13:33** *Jourdan*: Hey I got back to your email and followed up with meta team but they’re in Tel Aviv.   
  
Your mornings next week are a little full but checking to see if you have flexibility for anything morning cst/est after Mon &amp; Tue?
- **2025-07-16 13:57** *Ingrid*: Ah, I'm actually out Mon/Tues next week but I think you and Sharma to should meet them anyway (without me)
- **2025-07-16 13:57** *Ingrid*: so go ahead and book what works for everyone else
- **2025-07-16 14:01** *Jourdan*: Okay I saw you were OOO so sent times that worked with with your schedule but seems like mornings are best for everyone so I’ll follow up with them. \n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*

- **2025-07-16 14:03** *Ingrid*: i dont need to be on either - good to have you start leading those

- **2025-07-17 11:40** *Jourdan*: Yes i was but stepped away to the bathroom so missed that question. Here’s my notes from the convo  
  
**Action Items / Takeaways**  
• Sharma to **move forward with creative concept** focused on starter kits for younger kids.  
• Test **talking head format** with VO as preferred option.  
• Clarify **usage rights** on existing UGC content.  
• Identify assets that align with Ingrid’s vision of **elevated lifestyle and rituals**.  
• Ensure collaboration and **emotional clarity** among key stakeholders to reduce friction.

- **2025-07-17 13:06** *Jourdan*: Hey, im following up with Gui and need clarity around % of revenue  
  
“What percentage of your revenue comes from D2C, retail, and marketplace”  
  
W/ 36M on Shopify last 12 months I’m assuming retail and marketplace accounts are tracked off platform?  
Is it safe to say those 2 make up 20% of the total rev?\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-17 13:39** *Ingrid*: yes, 85% DTC

- **2025-07-24 10:55** *Jourdan*: Yeah for sure it would have to be something we work up to so people are used to the cadence and we’ll have to be driving enough new subscribers 
- **2025-07-24 10:55** *Jourdan*: Wanted to run it by you before I push for it with Elyse and Sharma. I know Elyse has a few bigger projects she’s working on

- **2025-07-25 13:43** *Ingrid*: damn, Meta looks SO BAD in this H1 review
- **2025-07-25 14:38** *Jourdan*: Yes i can get that done and Meta’s total impact is hard to measure with the conservative views we use but performance is down YoY . All paid social channels look rough compared to Google &amp; Affiliate but I think those channels are influenced by paid social. Hopefully Prescient sheds a lot of light on this in the coming months
- **2025-07-25 14:39** *Ingrid*: Yea, agree. Also now that you’re here we can right the ship on meta!
- **2025-07-25 14:42** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am! We’ll get it going in the right direction. I’ll give it a couple more weeks but I think we narrow it down to 2 products on Meta and test the new products as they come. Sauna Blanket &amp; PEMF are roughhhh now that we’ve broken things out by product
- **2025-07-28 10:40** *Ingrid*: I think that's also a reason to go hard on creative for those 2 - we need total refresh, more UGC and landing pages built
- **2025-07-28 10:41** *Ingrid*: (for blanket and PEMF) those are super important to not lose on
- **2025-07-28 10:43** *Jourdan*: Aligned and in my weekly report for more creative on those 2\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*

- **2025-07-28 10:55** *Ingrid*: can you take a look- i think this captures a lot of what i need to see
- **2025-07-28 10:55** *Ingrid*: it won't replace your more detailed one, but i need one for myself and to report up to exec/board level
- **2025-07-28 10:56** *Jourdan*: Oh  yeah i have most this data pulled except Monthly trends may need to make a few tweaks but shouldn’t be hard
- **2025-07-28 11:11** *Ingrid*: ok rad
- **2025-07-28 11:11** *Ingrid*: thanks!

- **2025-07-28 12:54** *Jourdan*: I’ll have the executive one EOD
- **2025-07-28 15:16** *Ingrid*: yikes that was NOT a good start to the CTV
- **2025-07-28 15:16** *Ingrid*: we need to whip that into much better shape
- **2025-07-28 15:51** *Jourdan*: Good for review on projections. My biggest concerns are scaling Google that hard MoM
- **2025-07-28 15:52** *Ingrid*: what % of risk do you think there is in that number
- **2025-07-28 15:57** *Jourdan*: its an 80% increase in spend so i’d say 60-70%. We can start off hot and see how the account responds. That’s how I’ve traditionally done it but you usually need some sort of catalyst to support that kind of scale. Google is hot right now but I think im second guessing more because of the data/pixel bug\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-28 16:39** *Ingrid*: take a look - i made some tweaks
- **2025-07-28 16:39** *Ingrid* 💬 2 replies: please also add in the inputs for the new "Revenue Net of Spend" column, Chris' request
- **2025-07-28 17:08** *Jourdan*: Okay aligned and I’ll get that updated 
- **2025-07-28 18:33** *Jourdan*: Update on Exec summary, t it’ll be a late night deliver. I need to pull a few more reports for Shopify Data.

- **2025-07-28 18:41** *Jourdan*: next question in video because I struggled with text
- **2025-07-29 12:57** *Ingrid*: Yes - excellent question, for the exec summary I’m looking for brand health overall, not just media 
- **2025-07-29 13:00** *Ingrid*: Basically, I look at the Sharma reports to understand media in more detail: channel strength, campaign performance, etc. your reporting (and analysis) should be more holistic and include paid media since it’s an important contribution to growth but goal is to grow everything, not just paid. That make sense?
- **2025-06-13 13:03** *Ingrid*: hiiii

- **2025-06-24 15:33** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good
- **2025-06-24 15:51** *Ingrid*: This will go up against YouTube in my mind 
- **2025-06-24 15:51** *Ingrid*: So we should test both ahead of holiday 
- **2025-06-24 15:52** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good. Are we close to launching Youtube? I remember mentions from one of the calls this week but not a timeline
- **2025-06-24 15:53** *Ingrid*: Yes! It’s in creative optimization as we speak 
- **2025-06-24 15:53** *Ingrid*: Should be ready to test in July - we can dig deeper soon 
- **2025-06-24 16:02** *Jourdan*: Okay sweet yeah i’d be curious to see how these two act in the ecosystem
- **2025-06-24 16:02** *Ingrid*: That’s cool 
- **2025-06-24 16:02** *Ingrid*: The high intent audience 
- **2025-06-24 16:03** *Jourdan*: Yeah definitely this is data meta used to show us
- **2025-06-24 16:08** *Ingrid*: I’ll setup time for us so we can chat through budgeting for the rest of the year and see how we can fit in a test here
- **2025-06-24 16:23** *Jourdan*: Okay thank you
- **2025-06-24 16:23** *Jourdan*: how do i see amazon performance? I don’t see it as a line item in North Beam
- **2025-06-25 11:11** *Ingrid*: let's go through Amazon stuff together when we chat tomororw
- **2025-06-25 11:12** *Ingrid*: I also want to make sure you're able to join that Decile call today at 1pm, would love you to own that data and relationship, I think it's powerful and I never had the time to unlock it properly

- **2025-06-25 13:03** *Ingrid*: word, i knew you would like it
- **2025-06-25 13:03** *Jourdan*: Decile had a lot of interesting insights around customer data. Perfect tool to use for figuring out Paid Hero products and which lead to higher LTV
- **2025-06-25 13:03** *Jourdan*: The highdration kit was not on my radar at all
- **2025-06-25 13:03** *Ingrid*: yes! ok yea def dig into how we operationalize the decile data
- **2025-06-25 13:04** *Ingrid*: the highdraytion powder is gross imo
- **2025-06-25 13:04** *Ingrid*: we need a new formulation lol
- **2025-06-25 13:05** *Jourdan*: I think most have been given away for free at this point.  22% customer share ratio and and crazy 1st time rev so i feel like people we’re buying other products and this was a free gift + purchase item\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-25 at 11.04.43.png** (png, 190.7KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F093FM9AAKB/screenshot_2025-06-25_at_11.04.43.png)

- **2025-06-30 11:21** *Ingrid*: cool no prob
- **2025-06-30 11:39** *Jourdan*: So iffy on pinterest platform reporting but thats based in bias on previous experiences. Im open to exploring here just need reporting based on in platform 1 day attribution to make decisions

- **2025-06-30 17:39** *Jourdan*: working on individual months now
- **2025-06-30 17:42** *Jourdan*: Is the 1.6 m on $350k in spend is for all paid channels and is that Shopify Rev only?
- **2025-06-30 17:43** *Jourdan*: Basically should i update sales goal on july tab to 1.6 m because i see spend is at $350k
- **2025-06-30 20:49** *Ingrid*: Well let’s discuss it and align to a reasonable but but stretch goal to get everyone focused 
- **2025-06-30 20:50** *Ingrid*: I’ll review the doc tomorrow and then we can catch about H2 budgets and goals to make sure we are tracking to where we need to be on both spend and sales 
- **2025-06-30 20:52** *Jourdan*: Okay awesome I’ll work on individual months so we have some starting projections to work with 
- **2025-06-30 20:52** *Ingrid*: Perfect, thank you!

- **2025-07-01 11:45** *Jourdan*: I see its been completed, I’ll keep this same format for next week. I changed it last week and there’s a handful of new metrics that people may not be familiar with
- **2025-07-01 11:56** *Ingrid*: ok great - can you do one that is H1 now that it's over?
- **2025-07-01 11:57** *Jourdan*: So DTC performance recap from Jan to June right?
- **2025-07-01 12:00** *Ingrid*: Yes please 
- **2025-07-01 13:17** *Jourdan*: Updated Summaries with projections
- **2025-07-01 13:17** *Jourdan*: Used previous years growth and applied to sales and spend to get 2025 projections
- **2025-07-01 13:18** *Jourdan*: I left a formula key but if it doesn’t make sense let me know
- **2025-07-01 13:18** *Jourdan*: I could also project based on avg growth since 2023
- **2025-07-01 13:19** *Jourdan*: Also updated the YTD table to give data up until the quarter we’re viewing. So Q3 doesn’t include Q4  and Q2 doesn’t include Q3
- **2025-07-01 13:21** *Jourdan*: and added an efficiency column so we can track total return. I think these numbers will need to be played with a bit because efficiency takes a hit if we model it after last years growth
- **2025-07-01 13:21** *Ingrid*: yea def need to adjsut these a lot
- **2025-07-01 13:22** *Ingrid*: the goal I have for total 2025 is 20% Growth	22%	5%	$8,307,513	$37,083,320

- **2025-07-01 13:24** *Ingrid*: the previous years data is all over the place so not the best guideline

- **2025-07-01 13:24** *Jourdan*: You’re welcome
- **2025-07-01 19:57** *Jourdan*: Made those updates. Spend in Q1 Summary didn’t reflect Affiliate spend so i updated that. If you check Q4 summary the totals are inline with your projections
- **2025-07-01 19:57** *Jourdan*: We just have to get super efficient the remainder of the year
- **2025-07-01 20:00** *Jourdan*: Moving to EOM and H1 reports

- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Ingrid*: i need to do amazon stuff with chris
- **2025-07-02 14:21** *Jourdan*: Okay no worries! I’ll get up to speed with them\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-02 14:23** *Jourdan*: Disruptors is Meta’s high level rep program. You get access to new products, have a rep with more leverage to get things done, run hold out test etc. Kinda gave me the vibes we had on the google call. Not sure if we’re in a special program there but i was surprised at the knowledge and access to tools.  You do have to qualify from a spend perspective over a quarter and I can assume Sharma has some brands in the program
- **2025-07-02 14:23** *Jourdan*: I’ve worked with 2 brands in it and it was a good experience. I’ll ask the team in one of our chats
- **2025-07-02 14:25** *Ingrid*: can you ask Sharma to get us into the program?
- **2025-07-02 14:27** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am for sure
- **2025-07-02 15:26** *Ingrid*: hey let me know when you're off with Bark

- **2025-07-03 15:11** *Ingrid*: can you look back on June 2024 Meta to see what rev it delivered?
- **2025-07-03 15:11** *Ingrid*: this number for june 2024 feels off
- **2025-07-03 15:18** *Jourdan*: 319,286.56 is what I’m getting
- **2025-07-03 15:25** *Ingrid*: from Meta in June 2024?
- **2025-07-03 15:25** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am

- **2025-07-03 15:26** *Ingrid*: soooo weird
- **2025-07-03 15:27** *Ingrid*: Chris in his tracker has $227k in meta spend
- **2025-07-03 15:27** *Jourdan*: Meta + affiliate?
- **2025-07-03 15:27** *Ingrid*: just meta
- **2025-07-03 15:28** *Ingrid*: ill connect w him on it
- **2025-07-03 15:28** *Ingrid*: thank you
- **2025-07-03 15:30** *Jourdan*: Hmm ok ok it might include other channels since it’s paid social. I can check other channels for that time too
- **2025-07-03 15:32** *Ingrid*: he has it broken out as just meta - it's ok dont spin your wheels on this one
- **2025-07-03 15:32** *Ingrid*: i had a good long chat with Ari about changing all our campaigns to product funnels
- **2025-07-03 15:33** *Ingrid*: she is fully onboard and we can revisit on monday when we all chat
- **2025-07-03 15:34** *Jourdan*: Okay sweet, I followed up with Jake and he echoed that. They’ll kick it off next week he just wanted to align with SB team
- **2025-07-03 15:34** *Ingrid*: perf
- **2025-07-03 15:34** *Ingrid*: thank you! yea - we'll then need to adjust all our reporting and KPIS, yay
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Jourdan*: Didn’t want to kick anything new off over 4th of July weekend. Would be nice to have produce specific goals too 
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Ingrid*: maybe take a stab at a new way to track all that - I'm still going to track the total business like we are doing, but on a daily/weekly we need to have Sharma report differently on pacing and performance
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Ingrid*: ha same minds
- **2025-07-03 15:35** *Jourdan*: Yesss lol it’ll make narrowing down to needle movers much easier 
- **2025-07-03 15:36** *Ingrid*: I'm going to work on a doc for how I am thinking about seperating
- **2025-07-03 15:36** *Ingrid*: and then share with you
- **2025-07-03 15:42** *Ingrid*: will also give us a clean way to create a funnel for the full size sauna
- **2025-07-03 15:42** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good! Do we have any sales resources to take phone calls to sell that?
- **2025-07-07 14:50** *Ingrid*: Hey - I may be a few minutes late to the 1pm with Sharma - go ahead without me and I’ll call you after 
- **2025-07-07 14:50** *Ingrid*: Mainly want to make sure we are on track with the reconfiguration of the product funnels 
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good. Google performance looks solid with increase MTD but getting concenred about Meta CAC mtd. L7 looks okay but its ballooned and ill get an update on single product camps
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Ingrid*: I’m just at the dr and he is running late 
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Jourdan*: Okkkk! I hope everything is okay
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Ingrid*: Oh yea just a checkup 
- **2025-07-07 14:51** *Jourdan*: Sounds good! Talk to you in a bit
- **2025-07-07 14:52** *Ingrid*: Also gentle reminder to do you performance marketing and DTC summary today
- **2025-07-07 14:52** *Jourdan*: Yesss ma’am saw the update come through (From Elyse) and have my calendar event\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-07 14:52** *Ingrid*: I’ll setup a weekly for us at 11am Mondays to review everything starting next week
- **2025-07-07 15:29** *Jourdan*: Call wrapped just some quick notes until we chat.  
  
• Campaigns shifted to single product by Wed EOD   
    ◦ Killing Legacy Campaigns (Holding Us Back)  
• Using Product Sets vs All Products in Meta Catalogs  
    ◦ Issue popped up w/ a bundle being served on IG that’s not avail on website.   
    ◦ Solution 1: Turn off product in Catalog so it doesn’t serve in Feed  
    ◦ Solution 2: Change in Shopify so there’s no chance of Shopify settings overruling Meta settings and showing the product as avail   
    ◦ Solution 3: Use Custom Product sets in Ads Manager featuring the Core 4. Could help w/ AOV and only serve DPA ads to high quality audiences which could lift performance on catalog campaigns.   
    ◦ I vote for Solution 2 and 3. SB doesn’t have ability to change on their end so this will need to be an internal update.   
• We’ve got a lot creative for PEMF and Sauna Blanket and some for Red Light Mask but could use more and not enough for Hat. Laura agreed to increase briefs for Hat &amp; Mask this week to be ready for Friday’s call. \n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-07 15:32** *Ingrid*: Agree - I like solution 3
- **2025-07-08 00:11** *Jourdan*: Here’s the written weekly report [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?usp=sharing)
- **2025-07-08 00:11** *Jourdan*: Elyse’s doc was updated earlier today
- **2025-07-08 00:12** *Jourdan*: I can include screenshots from Bark AI as those are inline with some of the images the previous GS provided
- **2025-07-08 09:59** *Jourdan*: If we’re not serving YT primarily then we may need to run some exclusions if possible. Not sure how i feel about these ads serving in Gmail and being effective
- **2025-07-08 10:00** *Jourdan*: Reminds me of an audience network placement on meta
- **2025-07-08 10:06** *Ingrid*: yea agree - bring it up on the google call?
- **2025-07-08 10:06** *Ingrid*: def chase jeremy
- **2025-07-08 10:07** *Ingrid*: thanks for staying on top of that - reviewing your summary now!
- **2025-07-08 10:08** *Jourdan*: You’re welcome! I just reached out to him. TT is the bad apple and if we can’t get it right i rather pull spend down and reallocate to AWIN or Google\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-08 10:08** *Jourdan*: AWIN looks juiiiiccyy with 35% increase in spend\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-08 10:25** *Ingrid*: yea we gave that channel the july 4th deal that only existed for affiliates!
- **2025-07-09 11:08** *Ingrid*: this would be compared to MNTN obviously
- **2025-07-09 11:09** *Ingrid*: need to evaluate which is better
- **2025-07-09 11:09** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am we’re on same page\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-09 11:09** *Jourdan*: Would be good to ask creative questions while we have them too\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-09 11:19** *Ingrid*: this is cool bc it's affilaite/sales based
- **2025-07-09 11:19** *Jourdan*: Could run both MNTN and this with them having two different goals
- **2025-07-09 11:20** *Jourdan*: Just curious what kind of offers they run on these channels w/ promos and QRs not being super effecitve
- **2025-07-09 11:21** *Ingrid*: yea, i guess my worry would be running them at the same time would inflate impact on both
- **2025-07-09 11:21** *Jourdan*: Yeah attribution could get muddy here since there’s no last touch
- **2025-07-09 11:22** *Ingrid*: word - let's pick one to start with then add the other
- **2025-07-09 11:22** *Ingrid*: let me know which you think is best to start
- **2025-07-09 11:23** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good. I’m 50/50 because there’s a lot of learnings to leverage from affiliates
- **2025-07-09 11:26** *Ingrid*: let's see what an adequest test budget would be
- **2025-07-09 11:26** *Ingrid*: we know MNTN is like 10-15k
- **2025-07-09 11:27** *Ingrid*: adequate*
- **2025-07-09 11:27** *Ingrid*: ah 15k
- **2025-07-09 11:28** *Jourdan*: Seems like we might get more bang for a buck with the $15k spent
- **2025-07-09 11:28** *Ingrid*: can you send the answers to these questions to her once she sends?
- **2025-07-09 11:29** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am
- **2025-07-09 13:39** *Jourdan*: Hey, just to keep you updated. Talked to Rahul  & Tori about scaling Google and adjusting T ROAS.  
  
We’re going to adjust T ROAS (15% Recommended by Google Rep) first. Continue w/ budget scale test for 30 days which ends 6.19.  
  
However a few campaigns aren’t scaling incrementally so we’ll make a judgement call on 6.19 to reduce spend.
- **2025-07-09 13:41** *Jourdan*: My thoughts… We push Google &amp; AWIN making Google our primary channel for spend while reducing dependency on Meta until we can meet a sub $800 CAC (1d, 1st time) KPI there. Already seeing this happen L30 with Google taking 35% of spend vs 31% on Meta. Ultimately we gotta get Meta more efficient so we don’t stress Google to hard and blow up CAC there’s a balance we need
- **2025-07-09 13:48** *Ingrid*: fully aligned and really appreciate the input and judgement call\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Jourdan*
- **2025-07-10 16:31** *Ingrid*: hey slack me if you need me on the call now
- **2025-07-10 16:31** *Ingrid*: i need to wrap up a few things and have already heard their thing
- **2025-07-10 16:31** *Ingrid*: im here just heads down
- **2025-07-10 16:33** *Jourdan*: Okay yeah no worries
- **2025-07-10 17:07** *Ingrid*: how did it go?
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: Still speaking with her but good so far
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: like the placement options they have
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: DOOH offering is pretty cool too
- **2025-07-10 17:12** *Jourdan*: the others didn’t offer
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: Just wrapped
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: Starting recommended budget is a lot higher than the others but they also manage for us
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: $100-150k for 3 months
- **2025-07-10 17:21** *Jourdan*: told her to come back with something in the 50-60k for 3 months
- **2025-07-10 17:22** *Jourdan*: They also mentioned canvases that surround the video creative featuring quotes and QR codes
- **2025-07-10 17:23** *Jourdan*: Liked that aspect because gives us the ability to incorporate messaging and give people option to visit website directly but after speaking with TV Scientific doesn’t seem that those are super effective
- **2025-07-10 17:23** *Jourdan*: she mentioned 30s videos as being most successful on their placements so gives a little more time for QR codes but still not that much
- **2025-07-10 17:31** *Ingrid*: ok yea, i def think they are too expensive for us and I'd suggest we start with the other 2
- **2025-07-10 17:31** *Ingrid*: how are our new campaigns doing this week
- **2025-07-10 17:33** *Ingrid*: also, loved your weekly one-pager. can you make one for YTD/H1?
- **2025-07-10 17:33** *Ingrid*: really want your analysis on how the year has been - what's been good, what needs to change, how we prep for H2
- **2025-07-10 17:39** *Ingrid*: i just left a few comments here for you too
- **2025-07-10 17:39** *Ingrid*: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?tab=t.0)\n\n📎 **GS | Weekly Report | 7.7.25** (gdoc, 133.2KB) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBJ99bHusBaUy0vNqfi2HXU2q4NyUQwW-uoPL8QiZAE/edit?tab=t.0)
- **2025-07-10 17:39** *Jourdan*: Okay yes i can work on the H1 breakdown\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-10 17:43** *Jourdan*: and we’re on day 2 so not a lot of data.  
  
However Red Light Hat is strongest campaign based on in platform data with 2.83 ROAS and $780 AOV  
Red Light Mask has one purchase a .50 ROAS  
PEMF Mat has one conversion at .9 ROAS  
Sauna Blanket has one conversion  at .08 ROAS but low AOV ($70) so i think it tracked a conversion from a different product
- **2025-07-10 17:43** *Jourdan*: $750/day budget across each of those campaigns
- **2025-07-10 17:45** *Jourdan*: I’d give til end of day 3 to assess
- **2025-07-10 17:54** *Ingrid*: ok cool - i LOVE having this level of product data
- **2025-07-10 17:55** *Ingrid*: let's try to move the needle on our YoY growth, down 6% is bad
- **2025-07-10 17:55** *Ingrid*: can you dig in and see where the bleeding is?
- **2025-07-10 18:09** *Jourdan*: Surface level, I’m sure you see this too but CVR is down 52%, AOV down 13%, and Return customer down 10%  although sessions are up 132%. Also seeing discounts higher ($52.7k) this month than last year ($38.7k).  [Discounts](https://admin.shopify.com/store/higherdose/analytics/reports/total*sales*by*product?ql=FROM+sales%0A++SHOW+net*items*sold%2C+gross*sales%2C+discounts%2C+returns%2C+net*sales%2C+taxes%2C%0A++++total*sales%0A++WHERE+product*title+IS+NOT+NULL%0A++GROUP+BY+product*title%2C+product*vendor%2C+product*type+WITH+TOTALS%2C%0A++++PERCENT*CHANGE%0A++SINCE+startOfMonth%280m%29+UNTIL+today%0A++COMPARE+TO+previous*year%0A++ORDER+BY+total*sales+DESC%0A++LIMIT+1000%0AVISUALIZE+total*sales+TYPE+horizontal_bar) doesn’t make sense since we didn’t have 4th of July sale.  
  
Sessions alone could explain CVR since we’re sending more traffic  
  
Sauna Blanket down 32% in Sales Rev but the Kit is up 26% so discrepancy isn’t that large.  
PEMF Pro Mat down 58%  
  
Silver lining, Body Sculptor has 32k in rev which makes up for some of the downtrends from existing products.
- **2025-07-10 18:16** *Jourdan*: How do we correct, push harder on Red Light Hat. Seems to be the most efficient product w/ paid media. This could improve Meta performance and drive more rev. However we need to improve Sauna Blanket and PEMF Mat paid media performance. Could be a creative solution or produce new landing page assets for those products.
- **2025-07-10 18:34** *Ingrid*: Can you please align with Laura for that creative brief due tomorrow
- **2025-07-10 18:34** *Ingrid*: Let’s include everything we need to push these softer comp products 
- **2025-07-10 18:34** *Ingrid*: She said you never go back to her?
- **2025-07-10 18:37** *Jourdan*: Looks like she tagged me in the brief last night (Im CST right now) but I just got back to her with a reply and added in Red Light Hat to her product mix\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-10 18:38** *Jourdan*: From what Jake shared we’ve got more Blanket and PEMF creative than Red Light
- **2025-07-10 18:38** *Jourdan*: however with sales being down we still need resources here to improve efficiency
- **2025-07-10 18:39** *Jourdan* 💬 10 replies: Do we want to focus on the Red Light Neck Enhancer?
- **2025-07-10 19:02** *Jourdan*: What products should we focus on for CTV? I know Core 4 for sure but are there any others we should include?
- **2025-07-10 19:03** *Jourdan*: Laura brought up Full Spectrum Sauna and mentioned Lauren has interest mixing topicals into our efforts  :eyes:
- **2025-07-10 20:12** *Ingrid*: I’d start with lifestyle and core 4 to start, it’s a good intro to the brand 
- **2025-07-10 20:12** *Ingrid*: Then we can add full size and topicals once we prove out the channel on the basics 
- **2025-07-10 20:13** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good
- **2025-07-10 20:13** *Jourdan*: thank you
- **2025-07-10 20:17** *Jourdan*: Okay any interest in Endorphin oil + sweat band, trans mag spray, and press?  
  
These are lower AOV so i assume keeping it to Red Light, PEMF, and SB to get us back on track would be ideal?
- **2025-07-11 17:06** *Ingrid*: Appreciate you being on top of sharma on those campaigns!
- **2025-07-11 17:10** *Jourdan*: Of course! I want to get this thing turned around asap. Meta can be a lot better which will lift the entire ecosystem and make rev targets at efficiency a bit easier. Seeing these segmented by product is so valuable! Thank you for being behind that push as well\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-11 17:23** *Ingrid*: Yes getting meta right will do soooo much 
- **2025-07-11 17:23** *Ingrid*: Go team 
- **2025-07-14 13:03** *Ingrid*: 2 min!
- **2025-07-14 13:06** *Ingrid*: here!

- **2025-07-14 13:39** *Jourdan*: Last question, are we looking at gross sales or net when looking at YOY?
- **2025-07-14 13:39** *Ingrid*: Net as it’s in Shopify 
- **2025-07-14 13:39** *Ingrid*: Sales after returns and discounts 
- **2025-07-14 13:43** *Jourdan*: Okay net is showing down 3%. It does look like we’ve got a good bit less of discount rev this year compared to last year but returns are up a lot.  
  
I’d expect net to be up YoY but returns make up the money saved with less discount rev.\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-07-14 at 13.38.39.png** (png, 136.7KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F095T0L78TE/screenshot_2025-07-14_at_13.38.39.png)
- **2025-07-14 13:44** *Ingrid*: It’s all solvable with more top line sales
- **2025-07-14 13:44** *Ingrid*: We need more cushion there 
- **2025-07-14 13:45** *Jourdan*: Yeah agreed
- **2025-07-14 13:46** *Jourdan*: we’ve got like a 4 day buffer before Google recommends we bump budgets again. Speaking with Anastasia now on increasing\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-14 13:48** *Ingrid*: Ok cool. I’m going to skip the 1pm sharma call but I’d like you to join and tell them what we jsut discussed (the sales gap, the wanting new top of funnel drivers) and let me know what they say. I’ll be on the tomorrow morning call though of course 
- **2025-07-14 13:48** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good
- **2025-07-15 09:34** *Ingrid*: hey jourdan are you joining this sharma call?
- **2025-07-15 10:48** *Jourdan*: Hey @Ingrid My mom fell this morning and opened her incision so I’ve been on the phone with her ortho’s office figuring out what to do. I’m sorry for the late heads up I’m just a little overwhelmed 
- **2025-07-15 11:14** *Ingrid*: Oh, man I really hope she is ok and I'm glad you're there to help her. Thanks so much for the heads up, I was super concerned!
- **2025-07-15 11:22** *Jourdan*: I think she will be just in a lot of pain. Thankfully her ortho reassured me and we’ll be able to get her to urgent care today so they can close it back up since it was glued. I’ll follow up with Sharma i see they reached out to lock in CAC
- **2025-07-15 11:59** *Ingrid*: ok, glad there is a plan to get her to a better place
- **2025-07-16 13:33** *Jourdan*: Hey I got back to your email and followed up with meta team but they’re in Tel Aviv.   
  
Your mornings next week are a little full but checking to see if you have flexibility for anything morning cst/est after Mon &amp; Tue?
- **2025-07-16 13:57** *Ingrid*: Ah, I'm actually out Mon/Tues next week but I think you and Sharma to should meet them anyway (without me)
- **2025-07-16 13:57** *Ingrid*: so go ahead and book what works for everyone else
- **2025-07-16 14:01** *Jourdan*: Okay I saw you were OOO so sent times that worked with with your schedule but seems like mornings are best for everyone so I’ll follow up with them. \n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-16 14:01** *Jourdan*: Sharma wants to meet with bark to establish KPIs by product \n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-16 14:01** *Jourdan*: Meta looks much healthier on the 7 day view \n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-16 14:02** *Jourdan*: So I’ll send a message out in a bit to coordinate. Would you want to be on that call? 
- **2025-07-16 14:03** *Ingrid*: the bark or meta call?
- **2025-07-16 14:03** *Ingrid*: i dont need to be on either - good to have you start leading those
- **2025-07-16 14:05** *Jourdan*: Bark call but sounds good I’ll include you in thread so you have visibility \n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-17 11:23** *Ingrid*: hey - are you on this call? i see you on but when i asked you aquestion there was no answer
- **2025-07-17 11:40** *Jourdan*: Yes i was but stepped away to the bathroom so missed that question. Here’s my notes from the convo  
  
**Action Items / Takeaways**  
• Sharma to **move forward with creative concept** focused on starter kits for younger kids.  
• Test **talking head format** with VO as preferred option.  
• Clarify **usage rights** on existing UGC content.  
• Identify assets that align with Ingrid’s vision of **elevated lifestyle and rituals**.  
• Ensure collaboration and **emotional clarity** among key stakeholders to reduce friction.  

- **2025-07-17 11:42** *Ingrid*: Can you please call me?
- **2025-07-17 12:03** *Ingrid*: Can you please let me know a time we can have a call today?
- **2025-07-17 12:08** *Jourdan*: are you available at 1230 cst?
- **2025-07-17 12:09** *Ingrid*: is that 1030 PDT?
- **2025-07-17 12:10** *Ingrid*: if so, yes
- **2025-07-17 12:10** *Ingrid*: call my cell
- **2025-07-17 12:12** *Jourdan*: yes\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-17 12:33** *Ingrid*: Ready when you are 
- **2025-07-17 13:06** *Jourdan*: Hey, im following up with Gui and need clarity around % of revenue  
  
“What percentage of your revenue comes from D2C, retail, and marketplace”  
  
W/ 36M on Shopify last 12 months I’m assuming retail and marketplace accounts are tracked off platform?  
Is it safe to say those 2 make up 20% of the total rev?\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-17 13:39** *Ingrid*: yes, 85% DTC
- **2025-07-17 13:39** *Ingrid*: rest retail/marketplace
- **2025-07-17 13:51** *Jourdan*: Okay thank you

- **2025-07-23 16:42** *Jourdan*: Hey are you opposed to getting on a daily email campaign cadence? It’ll take time to work up to that frequency but i’ve still got access to a few klaviyo accounts and they’re sending camps at a high frequency along with flows.\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-07-23 at 16.40.24.png** (png, 52.7KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F096RT9NJ23/screenshot_2025-07-23_at_16.40.24.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-07-23 at 16.41.30.png** (png, 70.9KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F097VBRSNM6/screenshot_2025-07-23_at_16.41.30.png)
- **2025-07-24 10:50** *Ingrid*: im open to it if we are very good about our segmentations and not blasting everyone everyday
- **2025-07-24 10:55** *Jourdan*: Yeah for sure it would have to be something we work up to so people are used to the cadence and we’ll have to be driving enough new subscribers 
- **2025-07-24 10:55** *Jourdan*: Wanted to run it by you before I push for it with Elyse and Sharma. I know Elyse has a few bigger projects she’s working on 
- **2025-07-24 11:02** *Ingrid*: yea, they are very good at taking strategy suggestions and working on testings, etc, im cool with you getting more involved and asking those questions/making suggestions
- **2025-07-24 11:03** *Ingrid*: ramping up new subs is critical
- **2025-07-24 11:48** *Jourdan*: Okkk awesome thank you for the reassurance 
- **2025-07-25 09:00** *Jourdan*: Hey can you get me a point of contact for the cardinal team? They should be managing the live site
- **2025-07-25 12:36** *Jourdan*: Thank you for connecting me with cardinal and apologies for the SMS platform mix up. Do you know if we were able to download the list segments and or migrate them to the new platform?
- **2025-07-25 12:38** *Ingrid*: no apologies needed!
- **2025-07-25 12:38** *Ingrid*: yes- talk to Elyse but I think all those transfers happened as part of the replatforming
- **2025-07-25 12:48** *Jourdan*: Okay sounds good ill reach out
- **2025-07-25 12:50** *Ingrid*: hey - can you please take a stab at the August goals?

- **2025-07-25 12:50** *Ingrid*: and put in the mid-month for July
- **2025-07-25 13:01** *Jourdan*: Yes I can work on that. Here’s H1 report [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ek0u7L6Sl7*oLIwrh04gEOsWdOI2cOrpqqevEcDRBGc/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ek0u7L6Sl7*oLIwrh04gEOsWdOI2cOrpqqevEcDRBGc/edit?tab=t.0)  
  
I can reformat but the data tables were hard to squeeze in on a google doc workspace\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-25 13:37** *Ingrid*: cool - can you have a draft of August goals to me for our 1:1 Monday? I'd like to review and then share with Sharma that afternoon
- **2025-07-25 13:43** *Ingrid*: damn, Meta looks SO BAD in this H1 review
- **2025-07-25 14:38** *Jourdan*: Yes i can get that done and Meta’s total impact is hard to measure with the conservative views we use but performance is down YoY . All paid social channels look rough compared to Google &amp; Affiliate but I think those channels are influenced by paid social. Hopefully Prescient sheds a lot of light on this in the coming months
- **2025-07-25 14:39** *Ingrid*: Yea, agree. Also now that you’re here we can right the ship on meta!
- **2025-07-25 14:42** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am! We’ll get it going in the right direction. I’ll give it a couple more weeks but I think we narrow it down to 2 products on Meta and test the new products as they come. Sauna Blanket &amp; PEMF are roughhhh now that we’ve broken things out by product
- **2025-07-28 10:40** *Ingrid*: I think that's also a reason to go hard on creative for those 2 - we need total refresh, more UGC and landing pages built
- **2025-07-28 10:41** *Ingrid*: (for blanket and PEMF) those are super important to not lose on
- **2025-07-28 10:43** *Jourdan*: Aligned and in my weekly report for more creative on those 2\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*

- **2025-07-28 10:55** *Ingrid*: can you take a look- i think this captures a lot of what i need to see
- **2025-07-28 10:55** *Ingrid*: it won't replace your more detailed one, but i need one for myself and to report up to exec/board level
- **2025-07-28 10:56** *Jourdan*: Oh  yeah i have most this data pulled except Monthly trends may need to make a few tweaks but shouldn’t be hard
- **2025-07-28 11:11** *Ingrid*: ok rad

- **2025-07-28 12:54** *Jourdan*: I’ll have the executive one EOD
- **2025-07-28 15:16** *Ingrid*: yikes that was NOT a good start to the CTV
- **2025-07-28 15:16** *Ingrid*: we need to whip that into much better shape
- **2025-07-28 15:51** *Jourdan*: Good for review on projections. My biggest concerns are scaling Google that hard MoM
- **2025-07-28 15:52** *Ingrid*: what % of risk do you think there is in that number
- **2025-07-28 15:57** *Jourdan*: its an 80% increase in spend so i’d say 60-70%. We can start off hot and see how the account responds. That’s how I’ve traditionally done it but you usually need some sort of catalyst to support that kind of scale. Google is hot right now but I think im second guessing more because of the data/pixel bug\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-28 16:39** *Ingrid*: take a look - i made some tweaks
- **2025-07-28 16:39** *Ingrid* 💬 2 replies: please also add in the inputs for the new "Revenue Net of Spend" column, Chris' request
- **2025-07-28 17:08** *Jourdan*: Okay aligned and I’ll get that updated 
- **2025-07-28 18:33** *Jourdan*: Update on Exec summary, t it’ll be a late night deliver. I need to pull a few more reports for Shopify Data.

- **2025-07-28 18:41** *Jourdan*: next question in video because I struggled with text
- **2025-07-29 12:57** *Ingrid*: Yes - excellent question, for the exec summary I’m looking for brand health overall, not just media 
- **2025-07-29 13:00** *Ingrid*: Basically, I look at the Sharma reports to understand media in more detail: channel strength, campaign performance, etc. your reporting (and analysis) should be more holistic and include paid media since it’s an important contribution to growth but goal is to grow everything, not just paid. That make sense?
- **2025-07-30 10:45** *Ingrid*: hey jourdan - I don't see the exec summary yet, am I missing it?
- **2025-07-30 12:13** *Ingrid*: let me know when you're able to do it
- **2025-07-30 12:22** *Jourdan*: Hey, yes i’ve been working on it the last few days so i can pull it weekly.
- **2025-07-30 12:22** *Jourdan*: Biggest struggle is performance by product since naming conventions in account are most organized on Meta.
- **2025-07-30 12:22** *Jourdan*: There’s still an all products camp on Google, and affiliate channels don’t have identifiers in their names so i can’t get complete data around spend by product.
- **2025-07-30 12:22** *Jourdan*: However i can break it all out by Rev and work with the teams on organizing in platform naming conventions so we can extract spend by product.
- **2025-07-30 12:22** *Jourdan*: Here’s what i got so far [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Du010WKNur*OFbHPQh*yAr3oRMJnFVCF0tOeb8kIL4c/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.pyj3wc98kqjx](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Du010WKNur*OFbHPQh*yAr3oRMJnFVCF0tOeb8kIL4c/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.pyj3wc98kqjx)
- **2025-07-30 12:22** *Ingrid*: Ok yes that’s a good solution for now
- **2025-07-30 12:24** *Jourdan*: Insights aren’t done either and the Total Paid Media Rev in the Exec summary is compiled by these channels. If you think i should add more let me know

- **2025-07-30 12:24** *Jourdan*: I pulled that from NorthBeam on Cash reporting since it said Paid Media specifically but if you want total shopify rev there instead i can pull that
- **2025-07-30 12:26** *Ingrid*: ok yea, this is the right level of detail - I think we need to add YoY change in the executive summary
- **2025-07-30 12:27** *Jourdan*: Okay i can get that added

- **2025-07-30 12:30** *Jourdan*: which would make that data a lot cleaner. Right now its relying on NB and those numbers look gross
- **2025-07-30 12:30** *Jourdan*: and not super accurate so few more teaks there
- **2025-07-30 13:39** *Ingrid*: def easier on GA4 i think
