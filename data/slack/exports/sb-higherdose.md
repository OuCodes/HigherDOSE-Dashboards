Hey @Jourdan, [here's the sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13_8Qp8uECRBg3T0wxocgl0mMlWpPLjydwduFLtHbwkw/edit?usp=sharing) which includes the most recently concluded search copy a/b test results. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks! cc: @Abigale @Ari Murray @Ingrid

**Jourdan** (2025-07-03 11:21:14):
Thank you @Rahul can you add me to the Wed meeting next week w/ the reps?

**Jourdan** (2025-07-03 11:22:49):
Good work on this too btw. Looks like you guys created a winning iteration for every ad group over that timeline

**Jourdan** (2025-07-03 11:24:33):
Looks like the old ads were paused from what i see in the columns so the winning variants are getting the majority of spend from increasing?

**Jake Panzer** (2025-07-03 11:30:09):
Hey @Jourdan @Ingrid- just wanted to note we plan on getting those attribution windows of the legacy campaigns changed before the holiday weekend as discussed!

**Jourdan** (2025-07-03 11:31:20):
Okay thank you for following up. Can we also launch a single product campaign for Red Light Hat ?

**Jourdan** (2025-07-03 11:31:32):
Just to kick off in that direction then optimize the account over time to single product camps

**Jourdan** (2025-07-03 13:01:00):
Hey @Rahul I’m projecting July performance and reviewing the account. I’m curious about some of the TROAS settings for PMAX campaigns.  I see the All Products campaign is set to 400% can you help me understand what determines the targets?

**Abigale** (2025-07-03 15:53:32):
Hi team! Noting that we are out of office tomorrow in celebration of the 4th but we will be staying close all weekend as needed. Please let us know if you have any flags from your end in the meantime, we hope you enjoy your holiday weekend! cc @Jake Panzer

**1DC NB L7**
**Spend: $6,200**
**Revenue: $804**
**ROAS: .13** (-35.58%)
**CAC: $3,100 (+30.90%)** 
Updates and next steps
• The body sculpt focused funnel has started off well both in platform and in NB.
    ◦ In platform: 4.54 ROAS $73 CAC
    ◦ NB clicks only: .68 ROAS 
    ◦ Awareness metrics: 62.3% LP view rate, .72 CPC. We will look to refresh this campaign to keep driving these metrics 
• In the pipeline is our full high aov product funnel
    ◦ We'll launch this if body sculpt falls off/budget supports!
Traffic campaigns in June (Roughly 12% of spend this week)
• .35 CPC, 1.56% CTR and a Landing page view rate 66.14%
[Creative Report](https://projects.motionapp.com/snapshot/1c57f4ef-091a-473c-9802-ac496beffacb)
• 027 V4 is our top performer in platform and on NB. The sound and text overlay are both key factors here. The background sound is consistent in the top performing body sculpt creatives 

**Rahul** (2025-07-09 09:09:53):
Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through our **search impression share and CPC insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms.

**Core Brand - Screenshot 1**
• Defending brand terms very well with an impression share consistently over 90%, over the last 8+ weeks.
• [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) have increased impression share over the last 4 weeks, indicating higher bidding on our brand terms. 
**Sauna Blanket (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 2**
• Defending market share well - still the market leader. [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) is our main competitor in the space. 
• CPCs seem to be normalizing over the last 3 weeks, showcasing a slow return to an evergreen state
**Red Light Hat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 3**
• Market leaders [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) have seen a significant drop in impression share over the last 2 weeks. Possibly due to scaling down drastically post promos. Showcases a need to scale significantly during sale periods to remain competitive with them.
• Competitors like [schoolofdermatology.com](http://schoolofdermatology.com) and [omniluxled.com](http://omniluxled.com) have managed to improve their share in the space and a new competitor has entered the auction house ([hoogahealth.com](http://hoogahealth.com)) 
• We want to scale this campaign by 20% this week to assess if we can capture some additional impression share, traffic and conversions. 
**PEMF Mat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 4**
• We remain market leaders in the space despite scaling down drastically in June. This indicates strong performance during evergreen periods. We also recently launched new ad copy under the PEMF ad group aimed at improving quality scores and impression share which seems to be working well in defending our share. 
• [magnawavepemf.com](http://magnawavepemf.com) remains our biggest competitor in the space. 
• CPCs are dropping / stabilizing, indicating a slow return to an evergreen state. 
Let us know if you have any questions :relaxed: cc: @Berkeley Clark @Ari Murray

**Rahul** (2025-07-10 09:20:12):
Hey @Ingrid (cc: @Jourdan), we met with our Google rep Tori yesterday and here’s what we aligned on—sharing for visibility:
• We’ll let the **Pmax scaling test** run for 30 days (from June 19 until July 18), then scale down any campaigns that aren’t driving incremental revenue post scale.
 • On July 12 (after Prime Day), we’ll **increase the target ROAS** on one Pmax campaign by +15% and monitor for around 2 weeks before deciding whether to roll this out to other campaigns.
 • **Demand Gen scaling to $500/day** will realistically need about 6 weeks for proper learning according to Tori. Let us know if you guys are down to up the budget to $500/day from the current $300/day.
 • Waiting on Tori to confirm what the **ToF YT Reach/Traffic investment** will look like.

**Rahul** (2025-07-10 10:58:57):
Hey @Jourdan and team, our Shopping campaign has had a bit of drop off in spends and revenue recently, so I did a little digging and noticed that *bundles* were the primary cause. I believe the bundle images which are synced to GMC showcases the evergreen offer, and because of this, GMC has disapproved those SKUs as promotional imagery is not allowed in Google Shopping placements. Would you guys be able to provide [rahul@sharmabrands.com](mailto:rahul@sharmabrands.com) and [berkeley@sharmabrands.com](mailto:berkeley@sharmabrands.com) admin access to your GMC, and also provide us alternate image links for each bundle that's live on-site, which doesn't showcase the offer?
Thanks in advance!

**Chris Jacob** (2025-07-10 13:05:41):
I've added access

**Chris Jacob** (2025-07-10 13:05:48):
@Sumish Khadka do you have the legacy images without the promo

**Ingrid** (2025-07-10 15:22:38):
@Chris Jacob let me look

**Ingrid** (2025-07-10 15:35:11):
confirming we don't have them without the discounts but I've asked Dani to take if off and send me a fresh batch - will share here

**Ingrid** (2025-07-10 15:35:41):
unrelated - @Berkeley Clark can we please make sure there are no Hyperrice bundles in ads?

**Chris Jacob** (2025-07-11 08:14:15):
FYI we had a sale on Nordstrom for sauna blankets which sold 150 units over the past three days so maybe some effect on DTC

**Jeremy Dranikoff** (2025-07-11 11:38:34):
Hey @Jourdan happy Friday! Please see [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i0FND-8p7CjiRzOjRk0AFC7nRfWXxWwSbYZHzLhYf1A/edit?usp=sharing) for our Tiktok relationship to the other channels and business as a whole. Happy to pull anymore numbers and explain this further anytime. Definitely some interesting insights here! We are prepared to take action on turning off the SPC and launching a red light mask specific funnel, but decided to hold for feedback. Let us know what you think. Thank you and have a great weekend! CC @Berkeley Clark

**Ingrid** (2025-07-11 13:19:21):
excuse me for stating the obvious but we are also on the last day of prime week (4 days this year) so that would also account for slowness in the DTC front

**Chris Jacob** (2025-07-11 13:29:00):
fyi both mask and red light starter kit got pulled from tt shop compliance working to restore

**Ingrid** (2025-07-12 14:38:23):
Bundle images with no promo sticker here!

The wholesale is lumpy because we don't get clean sell through data for everyone so a lot of data is based on when we large/bulk ship a PO  
In that regard I would look more at rolling 12 month columns than each individual month  
  
This is broken by underlying product (so a bundle is counted as one unit each of the component parts)\n\n📎 **Sell Through_March 2025.xlsx** (xlsx, 176.0KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F08LELCJVTL/sell_through_march_2025.xlsx)

- **2025-04-10 11:58** *Chris Jacob*: <!channel> i took a prescheduled call with Northbeam reps  
• They are available to Sharma for whatever if rollover help is needed  
• They are still failing to correctly clear out $0 order (we use for marketing comps and warranty replacements)  
• This affects anything in NB that relies on order count like AOV
- **2025-04-10 12:02** *Berkeley Clark* 💬 3 replies: @Chris Jacob We would love to attend that call and help move things along! We can also shoot through an urgent message right now to reps on our side to see if we can get the $0 orders resolved more quickly.
- **2025-04-10 15:40** *Chris Jacob*: <!channel> related to call just now it would be helpful to see if any info (even if imperfect) we have to date - few months of Northbeam, Motion, whatever - can inform any sense of the relative costs of converting into a sale of different products  
  
I have little notion of this and I think it can help inform a lot because, as examples  
• Blanket and Go Mat are same priced products - but very different maturity, ability for customer to understand, etc - what's our relative cost to convert?  
• A Pro Mat drops 3.2x a mask to the bottom line - I doubt it costs 3x spend to convert but even if it does the contribution margin gap is enormous

• In terms of ROAS, the volume DABA campaign lead the way with a 8.24x ROAS.  
• This is a trend we are seeing in the Meta accounts recently where catalog ads are performing at a very high efficiency level compared to normal ad sets. With this in mind, we are looking at scaling where possible to keep up with the momentum.  
• Net new actions taken this week was the launch of the TOF Sauna Blanket creative testing campaign. Along with the Oprah ads, we are launching the first set of SB ads into this campaign today.

Summary of optis:  
• Updated campaign objectives to "Sales" across Brand and Non-Brand Search to better align with performance goals.  
• Switched bidding strategies of two Brand Search campaigns to automated bidding across to drive scale.  
• Paused the underperforming Brand Sale ad group (0 revenue L60D) under US*Brand*Core campaign  
• Scaled budgets across top-performing campaigns to capture incremental revenue:  
    ◦ +10% on PMax Brand All Products &amp; PMax Non-Brand Sauna Blanket  
    ◦ +20% on PMax Brand Consumables &amp; PMax Non-Brand PEMF  
    ◦ +20% on Non-Brand Products Search  
• Reduced budget on PMax Non-Brand Red Light by 20% due to underperformance  
• Scaled down the three main Brand Search campaigns by 20% to assess top-line revenue impact.  
• Optimized all non-brand campaigns to bid exclusively on new customers (vs. just bidding higher).  
• Excluded brand terms from non-brand search campaigns.  
• Further scaled down US*PMax*NonBrand*RedLight by 20% — previous Apr 4 scale-down drove ROAS improvement without impacting revenue.  
• Paused poor-performing keywords in US*NonBrand*Concern that spent significantly without generating meaningful revenue over the last 60 days.  
• Paused low-performing ad in NonBrand*Concern*RedLightMask ad group to prioritize top-performing creative.

Actions taken and points for next week  
• Turned off underperformers in original SPC. Leaving only the top performers there to get everything we can out of them  
• Duped the SPC and kept only the creatives that had not gotten any spend to test if any of those are winners  
• Checked for usage rights and turned off the expired one  
• Working with Chandler and Blake to kickoff shop on the right foot. Would love to get something on the calendar with them for intros and learning  
• Start building true campaign structure as we get creative in

- **2025-04-14 16:11** *Ingrid*: Also, I'm worried we are not spending enough to meet/exceed those LY numbers - my suggestion is spending more on Meta where we have an efficient ROAS to at least 10% more than we spent last year.

- **2025-04-16 10:50** *Jake Panzer*: Hey @Ingrid, apologies for the delay in sending this through but here's the **non-brand search impression share by product** along w/ some insights to consider.  
  
**Screenshot 1 -  Sauna Blanket**  
• CPCs hovering around $3 - $4  
• Our impression share is the best in the space and is around 30% on average  
• With new ad copy coming in, designed to improve strength and keyword-relevance, we're hoping to see impression share grow further.   
**Screenshot 2 -  Red Light Hat**  
• CPCs hovering around $4.5 - $8. Slightly volatile. More competitors in the space  
• There was a hike in CPCs during the week of Mar 3 - Mar 24. The green competitor ([illumiflow.com](http://illumiflow.com)) seems to have had an impact there.   
• More importantly, the red competitor ([irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com)) has had higher impression share in the red light hat space consistently, so we'll be taking a few pointers from them for our new hat search ad copy.   
**Screenshot 3 -  PEMF**   
• CPCs hovering around a $3.70- $4.40. Seeing a rise from week of Mar 24 - Apr 7.  
• We're slowly starting to loose impression share while Amazon is slowly gaining.   
• For our new PEMF search ad copy, we'll be sure to take some pointers from amazon.   
Let me know if you have any thoughts / insights I might've missed. Thank you!

- **2025-04-18 12:36** *User_TS27JN*: Hey @Ingrid happy Friday! Two quick questions for you. Performance has been good on the platform and in order to test creatives fully and continue growth we'd like to increase our daily budget. We have kept where it was before taking over, but would love to have the go ahead for another $350 in daily spend (we are currently around $825 daily). That would add $4200 to the tiktok monthly budget for april. Second, I know we spoke about making sure the copy matches the creatives yesterday. While using this current campaign type tiktok assigns the copy and given its performance we would like to avoid shutting it down. With your permission we'd like to leave this one live and have our team whip up some more evergreen copy for the future!

- **2025-04-29 10:21** *User_TS27JN*: Hi @Ingrid and team here are Tiktok updates for the week. We did a look back of MoM as opposed to YoY due to the low spend in 2024.  
High level updates:  
• Chris is planning to upload category authorization documentation for shop. We will take over effectively completely from there in terms of set up and shop ad management. Affiliate split to come as we continue building the account and are in a stable place shop wise.   
Whats next:  
• Our plan is to test 2-3 creative ideas at a time at a high spend as opposed to spreading the account thin given high CAC high AOV.  This will help us be more intentional about learnings and hopefully speed up that process. While we do creative test the account will continue seeing performance fluctuation.   
    ◦ With that we are building a testing schedule for easy visibility/tracking (this will include various campaign types including manual, SPC, and search as well as the creative testing idea itself). We'll provide benchmarks for each test in this doc too.   
• We are slowly testing and phasing out the non sparked SPCs as creative fatigues, but definitely want to take advantage of some really great creative currently in the account while we can (heavy sauna blanket before it goes out of season completely).

- **2025-05-05 11:09** *Jake Panzer*: Hi @Ingrid, we wanted to share this with you directly before looping in the broader email thread with the Google reps. In short, we don't recommend scaling too much further in this time, given where we are at with efficiency. Often, we find reps try to push the limits of spend, so wanted to share the numbers below:  
  
• Last year (Apr 19–24, 2024), during the first six days of the Mother’s Day Sale, we spent $31,565.29 and generated $215,841.11 in revenue for a **ROAS of 6.84 and CPA of $92.53.**  
• This year (Apr 29–May 4, 2025), we spent $58,063.39 (+84% YoY) and drove $306,123.38 in revenue (+42% YoY), with a ROAS of 5.27 (-23% YoY) and a CPA of $110.72 (+20% YoY). These figures include late attribution.  
With scaling thus far, we've achieved incremental revenue at reduced efficiency. However, if we push further we would be risking an even lower ROAS and higher CAC and in this case, we would recommend holding steady with spend today or finding a middle ground.  
  
We also don't recommend maintaining elevated budgets after the initial sales phase ends as we expect efficiency to drop dramatically, but will hike back up again over next weekend. Let us know if you are aligned here - or prefer to push forward for topline growth in this time.  
Thanks!

**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPCs hovering in the normal range ~$3  
• Amazon's impression share rose quite significantly last week. This might be due to heavy investment on brand terms during the Mother's Day Sale but we're eager to hear your insights here  
• Dermstore's impression share stands at 15.21% (below than the max target of 20% we've given them) although it did increase slightly WoW  
**General non-brand insights**   
• CPC's have spiked quite a bit last week for non-brand / product terms, especially against the red light hat. We believe that this might be an impact due to heavy competition / investment during the Mother's Day Sale period.   
• We'll report back by next week on whether CPCs normalize but we think there might be a few weeks of high CPCs due to the sale season this month (Mother's Day and Memorial Day)  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• We managed to improve impression share last week along with [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com) despite rising CPCs  
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• Our impression share has consistently been low in this space. We're aiming to share new ad copy for review by early next week in order to combat this

We're setting up a call with the Google tag team on this subject but we require a member from your team that has the **highest level of access** to **Shopify, Google Ads, GA4, GMC and GTM** to also be on the call**.** Let us know who this might be and we can go ahead and schedule the call with the Google team.

- **2025-05-08 15:11** *Jake Panzer* 💬 4 replies: Hi @Ingrid, we’ve connected with our Google reps, Tori and Casey, regarding a preliminary **Demand Gen (YouTube) investment plan.** While their initial recommendation was a $100K/month budget ($3,333/day) to drive statistically significant learnings, we flagged that as outside our scope and asked for a more realistic alternative.  
They’ve since shared the attached plan, which outlines a "crawl, walk, run" approach to budget scaling. While our original recommendation was $7,500/month ($250/day), the minimum viable spend in their framework—the “crawl” scenario—is set at **$15K/month ($500/day).** Given this is the **lowest tier that still ensures meaningful learnings,** we believe it makes sense to move forward at that level.  
In terms of **performance measurement,** Google suggested methods such as a **search lift study (only eligible at a $1000/day budget) and accounting for view-through conversions** among other things, which are outlined in the **“Holistic Measurement Framework”** section of their plan.  
One thing to call out: we may see a **dip in overall account efficiency** by launching this campaign at a $500/day budget or more. Since Demand Gen focuses on **upper-funnel objectives** like awareness and consideration, we **shouldn’t expect it to perform on the same metrics as Search, Shopping, or PMax.** For that reason, we recommend **reporting on Demand Gen performance separately**, as it will likely contribute to downstream conversions across other campaigns or organic channels.

- **2025-05-14 11:36** *Jake Panzer*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through the weekly **search impression share insights** for **brand** and **non-brand (product) terms** :relaxed:  
  
**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPCs have increased. Corresponds to a rise in impression share by [dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com), [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) and [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com).  
• This could be a result of these **competitors investing heavily** across the board during their **Mother's Day promos**.  
• [dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com) **surpassed the maximum target impression share** we've provided them (20%) last week. Stood at 32%. We recommend **escalating this** to them right away.  
• Finally, [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) has been increasingly bidding on our branded terms and captured the **best impression share among all competitors** last week. We'll keep a close eye here.  
**General non-brand insights**  
• CPCs fell last week but still high.  
• As mentioned in last week's update, we're seeing **CPCs trending up starting from the week of 4/21** which corresponds to increased competition in the ad auction heading into MD.  
• We might notice **higher CPCs** towards the latter part of the month as well due to **increased competition during MDW**  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com)'s impression share rose significantly last week while [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) also managed to increase impression share slightly  
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• Impression share of market leaders like [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) are falling while new brands like [currentbody.ca](http://currentbody.ca), [schoolofdermatology.com](http://schoolofdermatology.com) and [omniluxled.com](http://omniluxled.com) have recently started gaining impression share.  
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• Over the last 2 weeks, we've managed to increase our impression share (which we were losing earlier to others). New copy should help us improve this further.

**Core Brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPC's have normalized last week as expected, being the week after Mother's Day week  
• **[dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com) still bidding high** on our **brand terms surpassing the max. impression share** we've provided them for the second week in a row. We should ideally escalate ASAP!   
• [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) still having a relatively high impression share  
**Sauna Blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• CPC's have dropped last week as expected, being the week after Mother's Day week. It fell below the general average of ~$3.6 - $4.  
• While we managed to improve our impression share over the last 2 weeks, so has [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com). So did [instyle.com](http://instyle.com) and [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) over last week.  
• We also launched new Sharma ad copy under this non-brand ad group on 5/15 and are hoping to see some good impression share results over the next few weeks.    
**Red Light Hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• CPC's have normalized last week as expected, being the week after Mother's Day week  
• Market leaders [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) managed to improve impression share quite a bit last week along with us.   
**PEMF Mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• CPCs have remained elevated last week, in contrast to other search ad groups, and are likely to stay high this week and the next due to MDW  
• We have lost impression share last week although we were gaining in the previous two weeks (probably due to high spending for MD sale). Competitors like [oxfordmedicals.com](http://oxfordmedicals.com), [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com), [magnawavepemf.com](http://magnawavepemf.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) have gained IS quite a bit last week. To address this, new ad copy will be prioritized for this ad group next week (after the MDW sale). Aiming to share for review by end of next week. cc: @User*7DB7H9 @User*PT7LCE

**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPC's interestingly fell well below average last week!   
• This might be due to several factors:  
    ◦ Competitors like [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) losing impression share  
    ◦ Our impression share improving to over 99%   
    ◦ Last week, despite scaling brand search (along with all other campaigns) for the MDW sale, our spending for core brand terms reduced while clicks increased. This means we drove very efficient brand clicks due to our promo last week.   
• [dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com) is still having an impression share that's higher than 20% for our brand terms (at 32.21%), although, it didn't have much of an impact on our costs last week due to points mentioned above. We'll evaluate their impression share and the impact on our CPCs next week and report back on where they stand and if they are still influencing our brand search costs.  
• Finally, we didn't notice other brands receiving an impression share against our brand terms last week despite running offers with certain retailers.  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• CPCs increased last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• Interestingly, competitor impression share dropped last week and our impression share grew, which was quite a positive trend to see!   
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• CPCs increased last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• Market leaders ([irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com)) as well as HD and [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com), were able to improve impression share last week.  
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• CPCs remained high last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• On a positive note, our impression share grew with scaling and we were able to beat out competitors that were catching up to us the week before last.   
• **New Sharma ad copy for PEMF** aimed at improving ad relevance / quality scores and impression share will be shared for review **this week.** [cc: @User_7DB7H9] This copy will help us maintain a good impression share vs. competitors going into an evergreen period while scaling down campaigns.

- **2025-06-04 14:25** *Jake Panzer*: Hi @Chris Jacob @Ingrid, here's a quick recap from today’s ***Google tag call:***  
• **Google Ads tracking** is confirmed to be working correctly via a test purchase.  
• For **GA4 tracking**, the rep said the current setup is fine, but asked us to check with your dev team / the team that set it up:  
    ◦ If they’re happy with the existing setup and recommend we continue with it. In this case, no further action is needed.  
    ◦ If they prefer / recommend switching to the new Shopify Google &amp; YouTube app setup. In this case, we can proceed—but we’ll need to **remove the current setup** to avoid duplicate conversions *afterwards*.  
Let me know what your team recommends. Also, it's important to not remove any set ups as of now, until we hear back from the team on the above.

- **2025-06-04 15:52** *Jake Panzer* 💬 4 replies: Hey @Ingrid, given the reduced paid media budget this month, we don’t currently have the capacity to test into Demand Gen/YouTube—though we’re definitely eager to explore it, as we believe it has strong potential!  
Right now, the entire Google budget is being used to support existing campaigns, so there’s no room to layer in YouTube within the current allocation.  
Google recommends a **$500/day** minimum for meaningful results (≈**$15K/month**), but if we want to stay budget-conscious, we could start with **$300/day** (≈**$9K/month**).  
Let us know if this incremental budget for YT is possible for June, or if you'd prefer we revisit it next month.  
Thanks! cc: @Ari Murray @Berkeley Clark
- **2025-06-05 09:58** *Jake Panzer*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through the weekly **search impression share insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms :relaxed:  
  
**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• Our impression share dropped off a bit last week (Generally 95%+ but last week it came down to 85%+). This is a result of us scaling down significantly last week to maintain efficiency during the last few days of the sale.   
• No cause for concern here since over the L7D, impression share is once again up to a 97.23% as we returned to an evergreen state.   
• Also happy to report that over the last two weeks, CPCs have trended down vs. evergreen (generally around $3). This could be the impact of us pushing dermstore to reduce bids and budgets for our brand keywords. cc: @Chris Jacob   
**General non-brand insights**  
• CPCs are still high last week vs. evergreen. This was expected due to most MDW sales bleeding into last week (high ad auction competition during MD).   
• We're expecting CPCs to drop off from this week (6/2) as we return to a fully evergreen state.  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• Over the last 4 weeks, [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com) seems to have improved their impression share which could be an indicator that they are bidding more into / scaling into sauna blanket terms, especially during sale periods.   
• Nevertheless, we're still the market leader and we expect to stay at this level as we return to an evergreen state while also having launched new ad copy which seems to be performing better vs. older copy.   
• We'll also ensure to scale if required to maintain our position as the market leader.   
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) still remain market leaders while [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com) also managed to improve their impression share last week, most likely due to high spending during Memorial Day.  
• We're planning on working on new ad copy under this ad group, which should allow us to improve our impression share and catch up to the market leaders during an evergreen state.   
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• We remain as market leaders in the space and are aiming to get copy launched soon (once approved) in order to improve our impression share further over the next few weeks.

- **2025-06-13 07:46** *Jake Panzer*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing this week’s Google Search impression share and CPC update for brand and non-brand (product) terms :blush:  
  
**Core Brand (screenshot 1)**  
• We bounced back from the slight dip in impression share seen during the tail end of the MDW sale, now sitting strong at **97.86%** once again last week (up from 86.19% previous week).  
• What’s even better -- **CPCs dropped further** to **$1.43**, the lowest in over 2 months. This downward CPC trend started in the week of 5/19 and may still be influenced by reduced competition from Dermstore on branded terms. cc: @Chris Jacob  
**Sauna Blanket Non-Brand (screenshot 2)**  
• Our **impression share improved slightly to 38.78%** last week (from 35.08% the previous week), while **CPCs dropped from $5.07 to $3.82**—a positive shift post-sale, as expected, as we head into evergreen.  
• [Hydragun.com](http://Hydragun.com) remains aggressive, still above 30% IS, but we’re continuing to lead. New Sharma copy may be helping us stay in the lead here.  
**Red Light Hat Non-Brand (screenshot 3)**  
• Impression share dipped to **15.53%** last week (vs. 19.04% the previous week), likely from the effects of returning to an evergreen state *with reduced budgets* in June.  
• **CPCs came down slightly** from $7.71 to **$6.90**, which is a step in the right direction post-sale but we expect it to reduce further / normalize over the next few weeks during evergreen.   
**PEMF Mat Non-Brand (screenshot 4)**  
• Holding relatively steady with a **22.10% impression share**, just a minor drop from last week.  
• **CPCs also dropped** to **$5.01**, down from $5.82 post sale, as expected. We expect this to reduce further / normalize over the next few weeks during evergreen.   
• Thanks for approving the new PEMF search copy. Once this is launched, we expect to improve IS and improve our lead against competitors.

**Tiktok Performance L7 (6/16-6/22)**  
1DC Northbeam  
$6,760 (NC)  
ROAS: 0.18 (+251% WoW)  
Revenue: $1,220 (+250% WoW)  
CAC: $2,250 (-66.73% WoW)  
  
Updates and next steps  
• The low AOV product funnel is fully built out and has been spending since Friday  
    ◦ NB shows a .11 roas overall with a .21 roas in the retargeting ad group. This has started off slowly and we’re making adjustments this week. If we do not see significant improvement by the end of the week we’ll look to end this test   
• Our next test is to focus heavily on the high aov products as opposed to the low aov ones and segment these out closely  
• We are preparing to move body sculpt to a conversion focused campaign in July as well. The traffic campaign has been excellent so far with a .22 CPC and a CTR of 2.62.

- **2025-06-28 05:29** *Jake Panzer* 💬 2 replies: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, apologies for the delay here. Sharing through our weekly **search impression share insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms.  
  
**Core Brand - Screenshot 1**  
• Impression share dropped to 91.91% in week 6/9. Correlates to scaling down post Father's Day sale on Jun 10.   
• Rose to **94.40% last week** most likely as a response to scaling back up based on Google rep recommendations   
• Staying strong above 90% for 7 of the past 8 weeks.  
• CPCs remain very efficient at **$1.68**, down significantly from early May highs. It has been under $2 since week 5/19 -- correlates to when dermstore confirmed they've been bidding less on our brand terms.   
• Key competitors (**Dermstore**, **Hydragun**) have pulled back / lost impression share over the last couple of weeks.  
• Amazon however increased their impression share over the last 2 weeks  
• Brand terms are well-defended with low CPCs, high impression share :white*check*mark:  
**Sauna Blanket (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 2**  
• Impression share rose to **33.41% last week**, recovering slightly from previous week’s dip -- most likely due to scaling down in week 6/9 and scaling back up in week 6/16.  
• CPCs dropped to **$4.66 last week**, down from $5.38 (Father's Day Sale week, 5/9) — a good sign of improving efficiency during an evergreen state although it hasn't reached true evergreen levels yet.  
• **Hydragun** remains our main competitor but is also trending down. **Amazon** managed to gain impression share over the last two weeks.  
• We have a decent lead, but still below May peak. This is most likely as we've scaled down dramatically in June.   
**Red Light Hat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 3**  
• **iRestore** and **Kiierr** continue to dominate the space.  
• Our share edged up to **11.41% last week**, but still far below the **31%** peak in week 5/9, likely due to scaling down significantly in June.  
• CPCs improved to **$6.08 last week**, down from over $10 in week 4/28. Slowly stabilizing post sales although it hasn't reached true evergreen levels yet.   
• **New Red Light Hat search copy** was launched this week and we expect to see an improvement in our share over the next few weeks.   
**PEMF Mat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 4**  
• Slight rise in share to **21.43% last week**, but still below earlier highs. Competitors, **Magnawavepemf** and **Healthnews** gaining ground. Likely due to scaling down significantly in June.  
• **New PEMF search copy** launched this week and we expect to see an improvement in our share over the next few weeks. We should also ideally think of scaling here to recapture impression share.   
• CPCs stable at **$5.05**, within recent averages. \n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.18.16 PM.png** (png, 418.2KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093F0GP329/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.18.16_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.18.51 PM.png** (png, 505.5KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093WFE289X/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.18.51_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.19.14 PM.png** (png, 550.7KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093F0H9W2Z/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.19.14_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.19.34 PM.png** (png, 524.0KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093BF2SGQN/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.19.34_pm.png)

**Spend: $6,200**  
**Revenue: $804**  
**ROAS: .13** (-35.58%)  
**CAC: $3,100 (+30.90%)**   
Updates and next steps  
• The body sculpt focused funnel has started off well both in platform and in NB.  
    ◦ In platform: 4.54 ROAS $73 CAC  
    ◦ NB clicks only: .68 ROAS   
    ◦ Awareness metrics: 62.3% LP view rate, .72 CPC. We will look to refresh this campaign to keep driving these metrics   
• In the pipeline is our full high aov product funnel  
    ◦ We'll launch this if body sculpt falls off/budget supports!  
Traffic campaigns in June (Roughly 12% of spend this week)  
• .35 CPC, 1.56% CTR and a Landing page view rate 66.14%  
[Creative Report](https://projects.motionapp.com/snapshot/1c57f4ef-091a-473c-9802-ac496beffacb)  
• 027 V4 is our top performer in platform and on NB. The sound and text overlay are both key factors here. The background sound is consistent in the top performing body sculpt creatives 
- **2025-07-09 09:09** *Jake Panzer*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through our **search impression share and CPC insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms.  
  
**Core Brand - Screenshot 1**  
• Defending brand terms very well with an impression share consistently over 90%, over the last 8+ weeks.  
• [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) have increased impression share over the last 4 weeks, indicating higher bidding on our brand terms.   
**Sauna Blanket (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 2**  
• Defending market share well - still the market leader. [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) is our main competitor in the space.   
• CPCs seem to be normalizing over the last 3 weeks, showcasing a slow return to an evergreen state  
**Red Light Hat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 3**  
• Market leaders [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) have seen a significant drop in impression share over the last 2 weeks. Possibly due to scaling down drastically post promos. Showcases a need to scale significantly during sale periods to remain competitive with them.  
• Competitors like [schoolofdermatology.com](http://schoolofdermatology.com) and [omniluxled.com](http://omniluxled.com) have managed to improve their share in the space and a new competitor has entered the auction house ([hoogahealth.com](http://hoogahealth.com))   
• We want to scale this campaign by 20% this week to assess if we can capture some additional impression share, traffic and conversions.   
**PEMF Mat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 4**  
• We remain market leaders in the space despite scaling down drastically in June. This indicates strong performance during evergreen periods. We also recently launched new ad copy under the PEMF ad group aimed at improving quality scores and impression share which seems to be working well in defending our share.   
• [magnawavepemf.com](http://magnawavepemf.com) remains our biggest competitor in the space.   
• CPCs are dropping / stabilizing, indicating a slow return to an evergreen state.

- **2025-07-10 09:20** *Jake Panzer* 💬 5 replies: Hey @Ingrid (cc: @Jourdan), we met with our Google rep Tori yesterday and here’s what we aligned on—sharing for visibility:  
• We’ll let the **Pmax scaling test** run for 30 days (from June 19 until July 18), then scale down any campaigns that aren’t driving incremental revenue post scale.  
 • On July 12 (after Prime Day), we’ll **increase the target ROAS** on one Pmax campaign by +15% and monitor for around 2 weeks before deciding whether to roll this out to other campaigns.  
 • **Demand Gen scaling to $500/day** will realistically need about 6 weeks for proper learning according to Tori. Let us know if you guys are down to up the budget to $500/day from the current $300/day.  
 • Waiting on Tori to confirm what the **ToF YT Reach/Traffic investment** will look like.

- **2025-07-10 10:58** *Jake Panzer*: Hey @Jourdan and team, our Shopping campaign has had a bit of drop off in spends and revenue recently, so I did a little digging and noticed that *bundles* were the primary cause. I believe the bundle images which are synced to GMC showcases the evergreen offer, and because of this, GMC has disapproved those SKUs as promotional imagery is not allowed in Google Shopping placements. Would you guys be able to provide <mailto:rahul@sharmabrands.com|rahul@sharmabrands.com> and <mailto:berkeley@sharmabrands.com|berkeley@sharmabrands.com> admin access to your GMC, and also provide us alternate image links for each bundle that's live on-site, which doesn't showcase the offer?  
Thanks in advance!

- **2025-07-15 13:51** *Jake Panzer*: Hey @Ingrid @Jourdan @Chris Jacob, more good news! I've managed to get most of our bundles approved on GMC, which were previously flagged as having promotional imagery and were disapproved. The fix of adding a supplemental feed with the new image links (without the promo stickers) worked :relaxed:  
  
The Sauna Blanket Starter Kit is still disapproved but I have requested a review from GMC. Will keep an eye here and let you guys know once it's approved too.  
  
I also noticed that the Summer Travel Glow Kit is missing on GMC. I can work on getting it added although I might need some clarity as to who manages the current product feeds on GMC. I've attached a screenshot of the feeds (data sources) connected to GMC. Once I know who currently manages them, I can work closely with them to get the new bundle added and make any further optis.

The other one you shared is all set now since I passed the supplemental feed to fix the issue. We can ignore the one from the Canada feed for now since we don’t have any campaigns delivering there.  
Would love to get a quick call on the books with you this week to walk through the current feed setup so I can get fully caught up.

- **2025-04-10 11:58** *Chris Jacob*: <!channel> i took a prescheduled call with Northbeam reps  
• They are available to Sharma for whatever if rollover help is needed  
• They are still failing to correctly clear out $0 order (we use for marketing comps and warranty replacements)  
• This affects anything in NB that relies on order count like AOV
- **2025-04-10 12:02** *Berkeley Clark* 💬 3 replies: @Chris Jacob We would love to attend that call and help move things along! We can also shoot through an urgent message right now to reps on our side to see if we can get the $0 orders resolved more quickly.
- **2025-04-10 15:40** *Chris Jacob*: <!channel> related to call just now it would be helpful to see if any info (even if imperfect) we have to date - few months of Northbeam, Motion, whatever - can inform any sense of the relative costs of converting into a sale of different products  
  
I have little notion of this and I think it can help inform a lot because, as examples  
• Blanket and Go Mat are same priced products - but very different maturity, ability for customer to understand, etc - what's our relative cost to convert?  
• A Pro Mat drops 3.2x a mask to the bottom line - I doubt it costs 3x spend to convert but even if it does the contribution margin gap is enormous

• Strong week in performance with ROAS and CAC both improving heavily in the account which resulted in a 14% revenue increase.  
• The main contributor in terms of revenue gained in the account was the Red Light Products ASC and the following ad drove home nearly 50% of attributed revenue for the campaign.  
    ◦ ***Ad**: MULT | VID | 16-20s VID | Lifestyle | Light | Red Light Hat | 040125 | Hat on the Go | PDP*  
• In terms of ROAS, the volume DABA campaign lead the way with a 8.24x ROAS.  
• This is a trend we are seeing in the Meta accounts recently where catalog ads are performing at a very high efficiency level compared to normal ad sets. With this in mind, we are looking at scaling where possible to keep up with the momentum.  
• Net new actions taken this week was the launch of the TOF Sauna Blanket creative testing campaign. Along with the Oprah ads, we are launching the first set of SB ads into this campaign today.  
• Along with this, we are also going to be launching the Red Light TOF creative testing campaign today too, heading into the weekend.  
[Best Performing Creative](https://projects.motionapp.com/snapshot/67f944b0c76352823f443bd1)  
• The DPA’s continued to have strong performance and the top 8 ads that spent over $750 L7 had a good mix of statics and videos.

Summary of optis:  
• Updated campaign objectives to "Sales" across Brand and Non-Brand Search to better align with performance goals.  
• Switched bidding strategies of two Brand Search campaigns to automated bidding across to drive scale.  
• Paused the underperforming Brand Sale ad group (0 revenue L60D) under US*Brand*Core campaign  
• Scaled budgets across top-performing campaigns to capture incremental revenue:  
    ◦ +10% on PMax Brand All Products &amp; PMax Non-Brand Sauna Blanket  
    ◦ +20% on PMax Brand Consumables &amp; PMax Non-Brand PEMF  
    ◦ +20% on Non-Brand Products Search  
• Reduced budget on PMax Non-Brand Red Light by 20% due to underperformance  
• Scaled down the three main Brand Search campaigns by 20% to assess top-line revenue impact.  
• Optimized all non-brand campaigns to bid exclusively on new customers (vs. just bidding higher).  
• Excluded brand terms from non-brand search campaigns.  
• Further scaled down US*PMax*NonBrand*RedLight by 20% — previous Apr 4 scale-down drove ROAS improvement without impacting revenue.  
• Paused poor-performing keywords in US*NonBrand*Concern that spent significantly without generating meaningful revenue over the last 60 days.  
• Paused low-performing ad in NonBrand*Concern*RedLightMask ad group to prioritize top-performing creative.

Actions taken and points for next week  
• Turned off underperformers in original SPC. Leaving only the top performers there to get everything we can out of them  
• Duped the SPC and kept only the creatives that had not gotten any spend to test if any of those are winners  
• Checked for usage rights and turned off the expired one  
• Working with Chandler and Blake to kickoff shop on the right foot. Would love to get something on the calendar with them for intros and learning  
• Start building true campaign structure as we get creative in

- **2025-04-14 16:11** *Ingrid*: Also, I'm worried we are not spending enough to meet/exceed those LY numbers - my suggestion is spending more on Meta where we have an efficient ROAS to at least 10% more than we spent last year.

- **2025-04-16 10:50** *Jake Panzer*: Hey @Ingrid, apologies for the delay in sending this through but here's the **non-brand search impression share by product** along w/ some insights to consider.  
  
**Screenshot 1 -  Sauna Blanket**  
• CPCs hovering around $3 - $4  
• Our impression share is the best in the space and is around 30% on average  
• With new ad copy coming in, designed to improve strength and keyword-relevance, we're hoping to see impression share grow further.   
**Screenshot 2 -  Red Light Hat**  
• CPCs hovering around $4.5 - $8. Slightly volatile. More competitors in the space  
• There was a hike in CPCs during the week of Mar 3 - Mar 24. The green competitor ([illumiflow.com](http://illumiflow.com)) seems to have had an impact there.   
• More importantly, the red competitor ([irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com)) has had higher impression share in the red light hat space consistently, so we'll be taking a few pointers from them for our new hat search ad copy.   
**Screenshot 3 -  PEMF**   
• CPCs hovering around a $3.70- $4.40. Seeing a rise from week of Mar 24 - Apr 7.  
• We're slowly starting to loose impression share while Amazon is slowly gaining.   
• For our new PEMF search ad copy, we'll be sure to take some pointers from amazon.   
Let me know if you have any thoughts / insights I might've missed. Thank you!

- **2025-04-18 12:36** *User_TS27JN*: Hey @Ingrid happy Friday! Two quick questions for you. Performance has been good on the platform and in order to test creatives fully and continue growth we'd like to increase our daily budget. We have kept where it was before taking over, but would love to have the go ahead for another $350 in daily spend (we are currently around $825 daily). That would add $4200 to the tiktok monthly budget for april. Second, I know we spoke about making sure the copy matches the creatives yesterday. While using this current campaign type tiktok assigns the copy and given its performance we would like to avoid shutting it down. With your permission we'd like to leave this one live and have our team whip up some more evergreen copy for the future!

- **2025-04-29 10:21** *User_TS27JN*: Hi @Ingrid and team here are Tiktok updates for the week. We did a look back of MoM as opposed to YoY due to the low spend in 2024.  
High level updates:  
• Chris is planning to upload category authorization documentation for shop. We will take over effectively completely from there in terms of set up and shop ad management. Affiliate split to come as we continue building the account and are in a stable place shop wise.   
Whats next:  
• Our plan is to test 2-3 creative ideas at a time at a high spend as opposed to spreading the account thin given high CAC high AOV.  This will help us be more intentional about learnings and hopefully speed up that process. While we do creative test the account will continue seeing performance fluctuation.   
    ◦ With that we are building a testing schedule for easy visibility/tracking (this will include various campaign types including manual, SPC, and search as well as the creative testing idea itself). We'll provide benchmarks for each test in this doc too.   
• We are slowly testing and phasing out the non sparked SPCs as creative fatigues, but definitely want to take advantage of some really great creative currently in the account while we can (heavy sauna blanket before it goes out of season completely).   
Thank you and have a great rest of your week! CC @Berkeley Clark\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-04-29 at 11.09.48 AM.png** (png, 93.8KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F08Q8UEG5GS/screenshot_2025-04-29_at_11.09.48___am.png)
- **2025-04-30 10:39** *User_TS27JN*: Good morning @Ingrid! We'd like to really lean in to the sale on tiktok without jeopardizing the learnings currently happening in the account. Would it be possible to have a dedicated $750 daily budget towards the sale during this period (and next sale period!) and return back to the normal budget after? For this week that would be an additional ~$3750 in spend. If we see performance tick up we can ping as well! Let me know what you think. Thank you!

- **2025-05-05 09:24** *Chris Jacob*: working on it
- **2025-05-05 11:09** *Jake Panzer*: Hi @Ingrid, we wanted to share this with you directly before looping in the broader email thread with the Google reps. In short, we don't recommend scaling too much further in this time, given where we are at with efficiency. Often, we find reps try to push the limits of spend, so wanted to share the numbers below:  
  
• Last year (Apr 19–24, 2024), during the first six days of the Mother’s Day Sale, we spent $31,565.29 and generated $215,841.11 in revenue for a **ROAS of 6.84 and CPA of $92.53.**  
• This year (Apr 29–May 4, 2025), we spent $58,063.39 (+84% YoY) and drove $306,123.38 in revenue (+42% YoY), with a ROAS of 5.27 (-23% YoY) and a CPA of $110.72 (+20% YoY). These figures include late attribution.  
With scaling thus far, we've achieved incremental revenue at reduced efficiency. However, if we push further we would be risking an even lower ROAS and higher CAC and in this case, we would recommend holding steady with spend today or finding a middle ground.  
  
We also don't recommend maintaining elevated budgets after the initial sales phase ends as we expect efficiency to drop dramatically, but will hike back up again over next weekend. Let us know if you are aligned here - or prefer to push forward for topline growth in this time.  
Thanks!

We increased spend during this period, however we saw a legitimate incremental rise in sessions during this time. This just continues to confirm the idea of tiktok's lift into other channels as opposed to purely in platform purchases.

**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPCs hovering in the normal range ~$3  
• Amazon's impression share rose quite significantly last week. This might be due to heavy investment on brand terms during the Mother's Day Sale but we're eager to hear your insights here  
• Dermstore's impression share stands at 15.21% (below than the max target of 20% we've given them) although it did increase slightly WoW  
**General non-brand insights**   
• CPC's have spiked quite a bit last week for non-brand / product terms, especially against the red light hat. We believe that this might be an impact due to heavy competition / investment during the Mother's Day Sale period.   
• We'll report back by next week on whether CPCs normalize but we think there might be a few weeks of high CPCs due to the sale season this month (Mother's Day and Memorial Day)  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• We managed to improve impression share last week along with [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com) despite rising CPCs  
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• Our impression share has consistently been low in this space. We're aiming to share new ad copy for review by early next week in order to combat this  
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• We managed to increase our impression share last week which were slowly losing in previous weeks.

- **2025-05-08 15:11** *Jake Panzer* 💬 4 replies: Hi @Ingrid, we’ve connected with our Google reps, Tori and Casey, regarding a preliminary **Demand Gen (YouTube) investment plan.** While their initial recommendation was a $100K/month budget ($3,333/day) to drive statistically significant learnings, we flagged that as outside our scope and asked for a more realistic alternative.  
They’ve since shared the attached plan, which outlines a "crawl, walk, run" approach to budget scaling. While our original recommendation was $7,500/month ($250/day), the minimum viable spend in their framework—the “crawl” scenario—is set at **$15K/month ($500/day).** Given this is the **lowest tier that still ensures meaningful learnings,** we believe it makes sense to move forward at that level.  
In terms of **performance measurement,** Google suggested methods such as a **search lift study (only eligible at a $1000/day budget) and accounting for view-through conversions** among other things, which are outlined in the **“Holistic Measurement Framework”** section of their plan.  
One thing to call out: we may see a **dip in overall account efficiency** by launching this campaign at a $500/day budget or more. Since Demand Gen focuses on **upper-funnel objectives** like awareness and consideration, we **shouldn’t expect it to perform on the same metrics as Search, Shopping, or PMax.** For that reason, we recommend **reporting on Demand Gen performance separately**, as it will likely contribute to downstream conversions across other campaigns or organic channels.

- **2025-05-14 11:36** *Jake Panzer*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through the weekly **search impression share insights** for **brand** and **non-brand (product) terms** :relaxed:  
  
**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPCs have increased. Corresponds to a rise in impression share by [dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com), [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) and [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com).  
• This could be a result of these **competitors investing heavily** across the board during their **Mother's Day promos**.  
• [dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com) **surpassed the maximum target impression share** we've provided them (20%) last week. Stood at 32%. We recommend **escalating this** to them right away.  
• Finally, [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) has been increasingly bidding on our branded terms and captured the **best impression share among all competitors** last week. We'll keep a close eye here.  
**General non-brand insights**  
• CPCs fell last week but still high.  
• As mentioned in last week's update, we're seeing **CPCs trending up starting from the week of 4/21** which corresponds to increased competition in the ad auction heading into MD.  
• We might notice **higher CPCs** towards the latter part of the month as well due to **increased competition during MDW**  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com)'s impression share rose significantly last week while [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) also managed to increase impression share slightly  
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• Impression share of market leaders like [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) are falling while new brands like [currentbody.ca](http://currentbody.ca), [schoolofdermatology.com](http://schoolofdermatology.com) and [omniluxled.com](http://omniluxled.com) have recently started gaining impression share.  
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• Over the last 2 weeks, we've managed to increase our impression share (which we were losing earlier to others). New copy should help us improve this further.

• CPC's have dropped last week as expected, being the week after Mother's Day week. It fell below the general average of ~$3.6 - $4.  
• While we managed to improve our impression share over the last 2 weeks, so has [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com). So did [instyle.com](http://instyle.com) and [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) over last week.  
• We also launched new Sharma ad copy under this non-brand ad group on 5/15 and are hoping to see some good impression share results over the next few weeks.    
**Red Light Hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• CPC's have normalized last week as expected, being the week after Mother's Day week  
• Market leaders [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) managed to improve impression share quite a bit last week along with us.   
**PEMF Mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• CPCs have remained elevated last week, in contrast to other search ad groups, and are likely to stay high this week and the next due to MDW  
• We have lost impression share last week although we were gaining in the previous two weeks (probably due to high spending for MD sale). Competitors like [oxfordmedicals.com](http://oxfordmedicals.com), [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com), [magnawavepemf.com](http://magnawavepemf.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) have gained IS quite a bit last week. To address this, new ad copy will be prioritized for this ad group next week (after the MDW sale). Aiming to share for review by end of next week. cc: @User*7DB7H9 @User*PT7LCE

**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPC's interestingly fell well below average last week!   
• This might be due to several factors:  
    ◦ Competitors like [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) losing impression share  
    ◦ Our impression share improving to over 99%   
    ◦ Last week, despite scaling brand search (along with all other campaigns) for the MDW sale, our spending for core brand terms reduced while clicks increased. This means we drove very efficient brand clicks due to our promo last week.   
• [dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com) is still having an impression share that's higher than 20% for our brand terms (at 32.21%), although, it didn't have much of an impact on our costs last week due to points mentioned above. We'll evaluate their impression share and the impact on our CPCs next week and report back on where they stand and if they are still influencing our brand search costs.  
• Finally, we didn't notice other brands receiving an impression share against our brand terms last week despite running offers with certain retailers.  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• CPCs increased last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• Interestingly, competitor impression share dropped last week and our impression share grew, which was quite a positive trend to see!   
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• CPCs increased last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• Market leaders ([irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com)) as well as HD and [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com), were able to improve impression share last week.  
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• CPCs remained high last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• On a positive note, our impression share grew with scaling and we were able to beat out competitors that were catching up to us the week before last.   
• **New Sharma ad copy for PEMF** aimed at improving ad relevance / quality scores and impression share will be shared for review **this week.** [cc: @User_7DB7H9] This copy will help us maintain a good impression share vs. competitors going into an evergreen period while scaling down campaigns.

- **2025-06-04 14:25** *Jake Panzer*: Hi @Chris Jacob @Ingrid, here's a quick recap from today’s ***Google tag call:***  
• **Google Ads tracking** is confirmed to be working correctly via a test purchase.  
• For **GA4 tracking**, the rep said the current setup is fine, but asked us to check with your dev team / the team that set it up:  
    ◦ If they’re happy with the existing setup and recommend we continue with it. In this case, no further action is needed.  
    ◦ If they prefer / recommend switching to the new Shopify Google &amp; YouTube app setup. In this case, we can proceed—but we’ll need to **remove the current setup** to avoid duplicate conversions *afterwards*.  
Let me know what your team recommends. Also, it's important to not remove any set ups as of now, until we hear back from the team on the above.

- **2025-06-04 15:52** *Jake Panzer* 💬 4 replies: Hey @Ingrid, given the reduced paid media budget this month, we don’t currently have the capacity to test into Demand Gen/YouTube—though we’re definitely eager to explore it, as we believe it has strong potential!  
Right now, the entire Google budget is being used to support existing campaigns, so there’s no room to layer in YouTube within the current allocation.  
Google recommends a **$500/day** minimum for meaningful results (≈**$15K/month**), but if we want to stay budget-conscious, we could start with **$300/day** (≈**$9K/month**).  
Let us know if this incremental budget for YT is possible for June, or if you'd prefer we revisit it next month.  
Thanks! cc: @Ari Murray @Berkeley Clark
- **2025-06-05 09:58** *Jake Panzer*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through the weekly **search impression share insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms :relaxed:  
  
**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• Our impression share dropped off a bit last week (Generally 95%+ but last week it came down to 85%+). This is a result of us scaling down significantly last week to maintain efficiency during the last few days of the sale.   
• No cause for concern here since over the L7D, impression share is once again up to a 97.23% as we returned to an evergreen state.   
• Also happy to report that over the last two weeks, CPCs have trended down vs. evergreen (generally around $3). This could be the impact of us pushing dermstore to reduce bids and budgets for our brand keywords. cc: @Chris Jacob   
**General non-brand insights**  
• CPCs are still high last week vs. evergreen. This was expected due to most MDW sales bleeding into last week (high ad auction competition during MD).   
• We're expecting CPCs to drop off from this week (6/2) as we return to a fully evergreen state.  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• Over the last 4 weeks, [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com) seems to have improved their impression share which could be an indicator that they are bidding more into / scaling into sauna blanket terms, especially during sale periods.   
• Nevertheless, we're still the market leader and we expect to stay at this level as we return to an evergreen state while also having launched new ad copy which seems to be performing better vs. older copy.   
• We'll also ensure to scale if required to maintain our position as the market leader.   
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) still remain market leaders while [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com) also managed to improve their impression share last week, most likely due to high spending during Memorial Day.  
• We're planning on working on new ad copy under this ad group, which should allow us to improve our impression share and catch up to the market leaders during an evergreen state.   
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• We remain as market leaders in the space and are aiming to get copy launched soon (once approved) in order to improve our impression share further over the next few weeks.

- **2025-06-13 07:46** *Jake Panzer*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing this week’s Google Search impression share and CPC update for brand and non-brand (product) terms :blush:  
  
**Core Brand (screenshot 1)**  
• We bounced back from the slight dip in impression share seen during the tail end of the MDW sale, now sitting strong at **97.86%** once again last week (up from 86.19% previous week).  
• What’s even better -- **CPCs dropped further** to **$1.43**, the lowest in over 2 months. This downward CPC trend started in the week of 5/19 and may still be influenced by reduced competition from Dermstore on branded terms. cc: @Chris Jacob  
**Sauna Blanket Non-Brand (screenshot 2)**  
• Our **impression share improved slightly to 38.78%** last week (from 35.08% the previous week), while **CPCs dropped from $5.07 to $3.82**—a positive shift post-sale, as expected, as we head into evergreen.  
• [Hydragun.com](http://Hydragun.com) remains aggressive, still above 30% IS, but we’re continuing to lead. New Sharma copy may be helping us stay in the lead here.  
**Red Light Hat Non-Brand (screenshot 3)**  
• Impression share dipped to **15.53%** last week (vs. 19.04% the previous week), likely from the effects of returning to an evergreen state *with reduced budgets* in June.  
• **CPCs came down slightly** from $7.71 to **$6.90**, which is a step in the right direction post-sale but we expect it to reduce further / normalize over the next few weeks during evergreen.   
**PEMF Mat Non-Brand (screenshot 4)**  
• Holding relatively steady with a **22.10% impression share**, just a minor drop from last week.  
• **CPCs also dropped** to **$5.01**, down from $5.82 post sale, as expected. We expect this to reduce further / normalize over the next few weeks during evergreen.   
• Thanks for approving the new PEMF search copy. Once this is launched, we expect to improve IS and improve our lead against competitors.

- **2025-06-24 10:04** *User_TS27JN*: Hi team- we ran out of time today, so here are our tiktok updates for the last week!  
  
**Tiktok Performance L7 (6/16-6/22)**  
1DC Northbeam  
$6,760 (NC)  
ROAS: 0.18 (+251% WoW)  
Revenue: $1,220 (+250% WoW)  
CAC: $2,250 (-66.73% WoW)  
  
Updates and next steps  
• The low AOV product funnel is fully built out and has been spending since Friday  
    ◦ NB shows a .11 roas overall with a .21 roas in the retargeting ad group. This has started off slowly and we’re making adjustments this week. If we do not see significant improvement by the end of the week we’ll look to end this test   
• Our next test is to focus heavily on the high aov products as opposed to the low aov ones and segment these out closely  
• We are preparing to move body sculpt to a conversion focused campaign in July as well. The traffic campaign has been excellent so far with a .22 CPC and a CTR of 2.62.

- **2025-06-24 10:24** *Jake Panzer*: Hey @Jourdan, these are the **"platform comparable"** metrics I was referring to, which are available for Demand Gen campaigns *only*. For these columns, conversions are attributed in a similar way to how paid social platforms like Meta attributes conversions, which gives a better picture on the true performance/impact of a Demand Gen campaigns.  
Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-24 at 8.52.48 PM.png** (png, 653.0KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F092T0CFCCD/screenshot_2025-06-24_at_8.52.48_pm.png)

- **2025-06-28 05:29** *Jake Panzer* 💬 2 replies: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, apologies for the delay here. Sharing through our weekly **search impression share insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms.  
  
**Core Brand - Screenshot 1**  
• Impression share dropped to 91.91% in week 6/9. Correlates to scaling down post Father's Day sale on Jun 10.   
• Rose to **94.40% last week** most likely as a response to scaling back up based on Google rep recommendations   
• Staying strong above 90% for 7 of the past 8 weeks.  
• CPCs remain very efficient at **$1.68**, down significantly from early May highs. It has been under $2 since week 5/19 -- correlates to when dermstore confirmed they've been bidding less on our brand terms.   
• Key competitors (**Dermstore**, **Hydragun**) have pulled back / lost impression share over the last couple of weeks.  
• Amazon however increased their impression share over the last 2 weeks  
• Brand terms are well-defended with low CPCs, high impression share :white*check*mark:  
**Sauna Blanket (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 2**  
• Impression share rose to **33.41% last week**, recovering slightly from previous week’s dip -- most likely due to scaling down in week 6/9 and scaling back up in week 6/16.  
• CPCs dropped to **$4.66 last week**, down from $5.38 (Father's Day Sale week, 5/9) — a good sign of improving efficiency during an evergreen state although it hasn't reached true evergreen levels yet.  
• **Hydragun** remains our main competitor but is also trending down. **Amazon** managed to gain impression share over the last two weeks.  
• We have a decent lead, but still below May peak. This is most likely as we've scaled down dramatically in June.   
**Red Light Hat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 3**  
• **iRestore** and **Kiierr** continue to dominate the space.  
• Our share edged up to **11.41% last week**, but still far below the **31%** peak in week 5/9, likely due to scaling down significantly in June.  
• CPCs improved to **$6.08 last week**, down from over $10 in week 4/28. Slowly stabilizing post sales although it hasn't reached true evergreen levels yet.   
• **New Red Light Hat search copy** was launched this week and we expect to see an improvement in our share over the next few weeks.   
**PEMF Mat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 4**  
• Slight rise in share to **21.43% last week**, but still below earlier highs. Competitors, **Magnawavepemf** and **Healthnews** gaining ground. Likely due to scaling down significantly in June.  
• **New PEMF search copy** launched this week and we expect to see an improvement in our share over the next few weeks. We should also ideally think of scaling here to recapture impression share.   
• CPCs stable at **$5.05**, within recent averages. \n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.18.16 PM.png** (png, 418.2KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093F0GP329/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.18.16_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.18.51 PM.png** (png, 505.5KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093WFE289X/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.18.51_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.19.14 PM.png** (png, 550.7KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093F0H9W2Z/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.19.14_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.19.34 PM.png** (png, 524.0KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093BF2SGQN/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.19.34_pm.png)

- **2025-07-08 10:04** *User_TS27JN* 💬 18 replies: **1DC NB L7**  
**Spend: $6,200**  
**Revenue: $804**  
**ROAS: .13** (-35.58%)  
**CAC: $3,100 (+30.90%)**   
Updates and next steps  
• The body sculpt focused funnel has started off well both in platform and in NB.  
    ◦ In platform: 4.54 ROAS $73 CAC  
    ◦ NB clicks only: .68 ROAS   
    ◦ Awareness metrics: 62.3% LP view rate, .72 CPC. We will look to refresh this campaign to keep driving these metrics   
• In the pipeline is our full high aov product funnel  
    ◦ We'll launch this if body sculpt falls off/budget supports!  
Traffic campaigns in June (Roughly 12% of spend this week)  
• .35 CPC, 1.56% CTR and a Landing page view rate 66.14%  
[Creative Report](https://projects.motionapp.com/snapshot/1c57f4ef-091a-473c-9802-ac496beffacb)  
• 027 V4 is our top performer in platform and on NB. The sound and text overlay are both key factors here. The background sound is consistent in the top performing body sculpt creatives 
- **2025-07-09 09:09** *Jake Panzer*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through our **search impression share and CPC insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms.  
  
**Core Brand - Screenshot 1**  
• Defending brand terms very well with an impression share consistently over 90%, over the last 8+ weeks.  
• [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) have increased impression share over the last 4 weeks, indicating higher bidding on our brand terms.   
**Sauna Blanket (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 2**  
• Defending market share well - still the market leader. [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) is our main competitor in the space.   
• CPCs seem to be normalizing over the last 3 weeks, showcasing a slow return to an evergreen state  
**Red Light Hat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 3**  
• Market leaders [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) have seen a significant drop in impression share over the last 2 weeks. Possibly due to scaling down drastically post promos. Showcases a need to scale significantly during sale periods to remain competitive with them.  
• Competitors like [schoolofdermatology.com](http://schoolofdermatology.com) and [omniluxled.com](http://omniluxled.com) have managed to improve their share in the space and a new competitor has entered the auction house ([hoogahealth.com](http://hoogahealth.com))   
• We want to scale this campaign by 20% this week to assess if we can capture some additional impression share, traffic and conversions.   
**PEMF Mat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 4**  
• We remain market leaders in the space despite scaling down drastically in June. This indicates strong performance during evergreen periods. We also recently launched new ad copy under the PEMF ad group aimed at improving quality scores and impression share which seems to be working well in defending our share.   
• [magnawavepemf.com](http://magnawavepemf.com) remains our biggest competitor in the space.   
• CPCs are dropping / stabilizing, indicating a slow return to an evergreen state.

- **2025-07-10 09:20** *Jake Panzer* 💬 5 replies: Hey @Ingrid (cc: @Jourdan), we met with our Google rep Tori yesterday and here’s what we aligned on—sharing for visibility:  
• We’ll let the **Pmax scaling test** run for 30 days (from June 19 until July 18), then scale down any campaigns that aren’t driving incremental revenue post scale.  
 • On July 12 (after Prime Day), we’ll **increase the target ROAS** on one Pmax campaign by +15% and monitor for around 2 weeks before deciding whether to roll this out to other campaigns.  
 • **Demand Gen scaling to $500/day** will realistically need about 6 weeks for proper learning according to Tori. Let us know if you guys are down to up the budget to $500/day from the current $300/day.  
 • Waiting on Tori to confirm what the **ToF YT Reach/Traffic investment** will look like.

- **2025-07-10 10:58** *Jake Panzer*: Hey @Jourdan and team, our Shopping campaign has had a bit of drop off in spends and revenue recently, so I did a little digging and noticed that *bundles* were the primary cause. I believe the bundle images which are synced to GMC showcases the evergreen offer, and because of this, GMC has disapproved those SKUs as promotional imagery is not allowed in Google Shopping placements. Would you guys be able to provide <mailto:rahul@sharmabrands.com|rahul@sharmabrands.com> and <mailto:berkeley@sharmabrands.com|berkeley@sharmabrands.com> admin access to your GMC, and also provide us alternate image links for each bundle that's live on-site, which doesn't showcase the offer?  
Thanks in advance!

I've managed to get most of our bundles approved on GMC, which were previously flagged as having promotional imagery and were disapproved. The fix of adding a supplemental feed with the new image links (without the promo stickers) worked :relaxed:  
  
The Sauna Blanket Starter Kit is still disapproved but I have requested a review from GMC. Will keep an eye here and let you guys know once it's approved too.  
  
I also noticed that the Summer Travel Glow Kit is missing on GMC. I can work on getting it added although I might need some clarity as to who manages the current product feeds on GMC. I've attached a screenshot of the feeds (data sources) connected to GMC. Once I know who currently manages them, I can work closely with them to get the new bundle added and make any further optis.

- **2025-07-15 14:08** *Jake Panzer* 💬 7 replies: I was actually referring to [this summer bundle](https://higherdose.com/products/summer-travel-glow-kit), @Chris Jacob. The other one you shared is all set now since I passed the supplemental feed to fix the issue. We can ignore the one from the Canada feed for now since we don’t have any campaigns delivering there.  
Would love to get a quick call on the books with you this week to walk through the current feed setup so I can get fully caught up.

- **2025-07-18 12:07** *Jake Panzer* 💬 11 replies: Hey @Jourdan @Ingrid – sharing a quick update on the ***PMax scaling test***, since today marks the end of the 30-day test window (June 19 to July 17).  
  
*Overall, scaling results look promising.*  
**Here’s a breakdown based on *Northbeam 1DC data* (Jun 19–Jul 17 vs. previous period):**  
• *Non-Brand PEMF PMax* up 131% in revenue | 1.68 ROAS (+20%) | *NB 1DC*  
• *Non-Brand Sauna Blanket PMax* up 40% in revenue | 1.60 ROAS (-33%) | *NB 1DC*  
• *Non-Brand Red Light PMax* up 43% in revenue | 1.58 ROAS (+1%) | *NB 1DC*  
Note: The previous period included the *Body Sculptor launch and Father’s Day sale*, so we’re comparing against an inflated baseline.  
  
**From *Google in-platform data for Pmax* (Jun 19–Jul 10 vs. previous period):**  
• Impressions up 19%  
• Clicks up +35%  
• CTR up +14%  
• CPV down -14%  
• Revenue down -41% (likely due to the stronger comparison period)  
The drop in CPV supports what Google mentioned about PMax leaning more into *Top-of-Funnel placements like YouTube*, which helps build awareness efficiently.  
  
***Recommendation:***  
Let’s maintain current PMax budget levels, given the incremental revenue in 3 of the 5 scaled campaigns and clear improvements in traffic quality.  
  
***Budget note*** cc: @Jourdan @Ingrid:  
We’re currently pacing about **$30K over the $100K Google budget** for July. This was expected, as we committed to running the **30-day PMax scaling test** through its full cycle.  
We’ve noticed that the **influencer platform is under-pacing** against July budgets. Let us know if we can reallocate from there to help absorb the Google overage.  
If you’d like us to **scale further into top-performing PMax campaigns**, we’re happy to — but we’d need an **additional ~$2,800** for the rest of the month to do so.  
Let us know how you'd like us to move forward.  
Thanks! cc: @Berkeley Clark @Rahul @Ari Murray
- **2025-07-18 13:29** *Jourdan*: Hey @Jake Panzer thank you for the update and all the context that’s super helpful.  
  
We’re still down 9% YoY and since Google is the primary channel we don’t want to pull back if anything I want to keep pushing budgets on Google since we’re down 23% in spend Last 7.  
  
Do you have insights into why budget is pulling back?  
  
  
CC: @Rahul I also see some under performing campaigns on Meta like PEMF and Sauna Blanket that we could reduce spend on, shift budget to other performing campaigns, or shift the budget to google.  
  
I’d love to know both of your thoughts so we can keep pushing revenue up.  
  
I know we’re up against a few challenges compared to last year but we’re not too far behind on rev.\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*

The wholesale is lumpy because we don't get clean sell through data for everyone so a lot of data is based on when we large/bulk ship a PO  
In that regard I would look more at rolling 12 month columns than each individual month  
  
This is broken by underlying product (so a bundle is counted as one unit each of the component parts)\n\n📎 **Sell Through_March 2025.xlsx** (xlsx, 176.0KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F08LELCJVTL/sell_through_march_2025.xlsx)

- **2025-04-10 11:58** *Chris Jacob*: <!channel> i took a prescheduled call with Northbeam reps  
• They are available to Sharma for whatever if rollover help is needed  
• They are still failing to correctly clear out $0 order (we use for marketing comps and warranty replacements)  
• This affects anything in NB that relies on order count like AOV
- **2025-04-10 12:02** *Berkeley Clark* 💬 3 replies: @Chris Jacob We would love to attend that call and help move things along! We can also shoot through an urgent message right now to reps on our side to see if we can get the $0 orders resolved more quickly.
- **2025-04-10 15:40** *Chris Jacob*: <!channel> related to call just now it would be helpful to see if any info (even if imperfect) we have to date - few months of Northbeam, Motion, whatever - can inform any sense of the relative costs of converting into a sale of different products  
  
I have little notion of this and I think it can help inform a lot because, as examples  
• Blanket and Go Mat are same priced products - but very different maturity, ability for customer to understand, etc - what's our relative cost to convert?  
• A Pro Mat drops 3.2x a mask to the bottom line - I doubt it costs 3x spend to convert but even if it does the contribution margin gap is enormous

• Strong week in performance with ROAS and CAC both improving heavily in the account which resulted in a 14% revenue increase.  
• The main contributor in terms of revenue gained in the account was the Red Light Products ASC and the following ad drove home nearly 50% of attributed revenue for the campaign.  
    ◦ ***Ad**: MULT | VID | 16-20s VID | Lifestyle | Light | Red Light Hat | 040125 | Hat on the Go | PDP*  
• In terms of ROAS, the volume DABA campaign lead the way with a 8.24x ROAS.  
• This is a trend we are seeing in the Meta accounts recently where catalog ads are performing at a very high efficiency level compared to normal ad sets. With this in mind, we are looking at scaling where possible to keep up with the momentum.  
• Net new actions taken this week was the launch of the TOF Sauna Blanket creative testing campaign. Along with the Oprah ads, we are launching the first set of SB ads into this campaign today.  
• Along with this, we are also going to be launching the Red Light TOF creative testing campaign today too, heading into the weekend.  
[Best Performing Creative](https://projects.motionapp.com/snapshot/67f944b0c76352823f443bd1)  
• The DPA’s continued to have strong performance and the top 8 ads that spent over $750 L7 had a good mix of statics and videos.

Summary of optis:  
• Updated campaign objectives to "Sales" across Brand and Non-Brand Search to better align with performance goals.  
• Switched bidding strategies of two Brand Search campaigns to automated bidding across to drive scale.  
• Paused the underperforming Brand Sale ad group (0 revenue L60D) under US*Brand*Core campaign  
• Scaled budgets across top-performing campaigns to capture incremental revenue:  
    ◦ +10% on PMax Brand All Products &amp; PMax Non-Brand Sauna Blanket  
    ◦ +20% on PMax Brand Consumables &amp; PMax Non-Brand PEMF  
    ◦ +20% on Non-Brand Products Search  
• Reduced budget on PMax Non-Brand Red Light by 20% due to underperformance  
• Scaled down the three main Brand Search campaigns by 20% to assess top-line revenue impact.  
• Optimized all non-brand campaigns to bid exclusively on new customers (vs. just bidding higher).  
• Excluded brand terms from non-brand search campaigns.  
• Further scaled down US*PMax*NonBrand*RedLight by 20% — previous Apr 4 scale-down drove ROAS improvement without impacting revenue.  
• Paused poor-performing keywords in US*NonBrand*Concern that spent significantly without generating meaningful revenue over the last 60 days.  
• Paused low-performing ad in NonBrand*Concern*RedLightMask ad group to prioritize top-performing creative.

Actions taken and points for next week  
• Turned off underperformers in original SPC. Leaving only the top performers there to get everything we can out of them  
• Duped the SPC and kept only the creatives that had not gotten any spend to test if any of those are winners  
• Checked for usage rights and turned off the expired one  
• Working with Chandler and Blake to kickoff shop on the right foot. Would love to get something on the calendar with them for intros and learning  
• Start building true campaign structure as we get creative in

- **2025-04-14 16:06** *Ingrid*: Team, do we have any PEMF ToF campaigns that are going into testing? I'm worried that we are out of Sauna/Sauna blanket season so testing a ToF in that isn't a great use of testing/funding
- **2025-04-14 16:11** *Ingrid*: Also, I'm worried we are not spending enough to meet/exceed those LY numbers - my suggestion is spending more on Meta where we have an efficient ROAS to at least 10% more than we spent last year. I know I gave you the spend/sales goals last week so let's ramp it up this week?\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Rahul*

We'll take a look back at any winning campaigns that we can allocate more budget to. We also have PEMF Go Mat content being delivered tomorrow, I'll speak with our creative team about some shuffling we can do in order to get more PEMF ToF going as well!\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Ingrid*

- **2025-04-16 10:50** *Jake Panzer*: Hey @Ingrid, apologies for the delay in sending this through but here's the **non-brand search impression share by product** along w/ some insights to consider.  
  
**Screenshot 1 -  Sauna Blanket**  
• CPCs hovering around $3 - $4  
• Our impression share is the best in the space and is around 30% on average  
• With new ad copy coming in, designed to improve strength and keyword-relevance, we're hoping to see impression share grow further.   
**Screenshot 2 -  Red Light Hat**  
• CPCs hovering around $4.5 - $8. Slightly volatile. More competitors in the space  
• There was a hike in CPCs during the week of Mar 3 - Mar 24. The green competitor ([illumiflow.com](http://illumiflow.com)) seems to have had an impact there.   
• More importantly, the red competitor ([irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com)) has had higher impression share in the red light hat space consistently, so we'll be taking a few pointers from them for our new hat search ad copy.   
**Screenshot 3 -  PEMF**   
• CPCs hovering around a $3.70- $4.40. Seeing a rise from week of Mar 24 - Apr 7.  
• We're slowly starting to loose impression share while Amazon is slowly gaining.   
• For our new PEMF search ad copy, we'll be sure to take some pointers from amazon.   
Let me know if you have any thoughts / insights I might've missed. Thank you!

- **2025-04-18 12:36** *User_TS27JN*: Hey @Ingrid happy Friday! Two quick questions for you. Performance has been good on the platform and in order to test creatives fully and continue growth we'd like to increase our daily budget. We have kept where it was before taking over, but would love to have the go ahead for another $350 in daily spend (we are currently around $825 daily). That would add $4200 to the tiktok monthly budget for april. Second, I know we spoke about making sure the copy matches the creatives yesterday. While using this current campaign type tiktok assigns the copy and given its performance we would like to avoid shutting it down. With your permission we'd like to leave this one live and have our team whip up some more evergreen copy for the future! Thank you and have a great weekend CC @Berkeley Clark\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-04-18 at 1.18.59 PM.png** (png, 742.1KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F08NXA52J4U/screenshot_2025-04-18_at_1.18.59___pm.png)

- **2025-04-29 10:21** *User_TS27JN*: Hi @Ingrid and team here are Tiktok updates for the week. We did a look back of MoM as opposed to YoY due to the low spend in 2024.  
High level updates:  
• Chris is planning to upload category authorization documentation for shop. We will take over effectively completely from there in terms of set up and shop ad management. Affiliate split to come as we continue building the account and are in a stable place shop wise.   
Whats next:  
• Our plan is to test 2-3 creative ideas at a time at a high spend as opposed to spreading the account thin given high CAC high AOV.  This will help us be more intentional about learnings and hopefully speed up that process. While we do creative test the account will continue seeing performance fluctuation.   
    ◦ With that we are building a testing schedule for easy visibility/tracking (this will include various campaign types including manual, SPC, and search as well as the creative testing idea itself). We'll provide benchmarks for each test in this doc too.   
• We are slowly testing and phasing out the non sparked SPCs as creative fatigues, but definitely want to take advantage of some really great creative currently in the account while we can (heavy sauna blanket before it goes out of season completely).   
Thank you and have a great rest of your week! CC @Berkeley Clark\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-04-29 at 11.09.48 AM.png** (png, 93.8KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F08Q8UEG5GS/screenshot_2025-04-29_at_11.09.48___am.png)
- **2025-04-30 10:39** *User_TS27JN*: Good morning @Ingrid! We'd like to really lean in to the sale on tiktok without jeopardizing the learnings currently happening in the account. Would it be possible to have a dedicated $750 daily budget towards the sale during this period (and next sale period!) and return back to the normal budget after? For this week that would be an additional ~$3750 in spend. If we see performance tick up we can ping as well! Let me know what you think. Thank you!

- **2025-05-05 11:09** *Jake Panzer*: Hi @Ingrid, we wanted to share this with you directly before looping in the broader email thread with the Google reps. In short, we don't recommend scaling too much further in this time, given where we are at with efficiency. Often, we find reps try to push the limits of spend, so wanted to share the numbers below:  
  
• Last year (Apr 19–24, 2024), during the first six days of the Mother’s Day Sale, we spent $31,565.29 and generated $215,841.11 in revenue for a **ROAS of 6.84 and CPA of $92.53.**  
• This year (Apr 29–May 4, 2025), we spent $58,063.39 (+84% YoY) and drove $306,123.38 in revenue (+42% YoY), with a ROAS of 5.27 (-23% YoY) and a CPA of $110.72 (+20% YoY). These figures include late attribution.  
With scaling thus far, we've achieved incremental revenue at reduced efficiency. However, if we push further we would be risking an even lower ROAS and higher CAC and in this case, we would recommend holding steady with spend today or finding a middle ground.  
  
We also don't recommend maintaining elevated budgets after the initial sales phase ends as we expect efficiency to drop dramatically, but will hike back up again over next weekend. Let us know if you are aligned here - or prefer to push forward for topline growth in this time.  
Thanks!

- **2025-05-06 14:25** *User_TS27JN*: Hey @Ingrid had an interesting callout regarding tiktok during the sale period. We increased spend during this period, however we saw a legitimate incremental rise in sessions during this time. This just continues to confirm the idea of tiktok's lift into other channels as opposed to purely in platform purchases.

- **2025-05-07 09:49** *Jake Panzer* 💬 1 reply: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through the weekly **search impression share insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms :relaxed:  
  
**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPCs hovering in the normal range ~$3  
• Amazon's impression share rose quite significantly last week. This might be due to heavy investment on brand terms during the Mother's Day Sale but we're eager to hear your insights here  
• Dermstore's impression share stands at 15.21% (below than the max target of 20% we've given them) although it did increase slightly WoW  
**General non-brand insights**   
• CPC's have spiked quite a bit last week for non-brand / product terms, especially against the red light hat. We believe that this might be an impact due to heavy competition / investment during the Mother's Day Sale period.   
• We'll report back by next week on whether CPCs normalize but we think there might be a few weeks of high CPCs due to the sale season this month (Mother's Day and Memorial Day)  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• We managed to improve impression share last week along with [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com) despite rising CPCs  
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• Our impression share has consistently been low in this space. We're aiming to share new ad copy for review by early next week in order to combat this  
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• We managed to increase our impression share last week which were slowly losing in previous weeks.

While our original recommendation was $7,500/month ($250/day), the minimum viable spend in their framework—the “crawl” scenario—is set at **$15K/month ($500/day).** Given this is the **lowest tier that still ensures meaningful learnings,** we believe it makes sense to move forward at that level.  
In terms of **performance measurement,** Google suggested methods such as a **search lift study (only eligible at a $1000/day budget) and accounting for view-through conversions** among other things, which are outlined in the **“Holistic Measurement Framework”** section of their plan.  
One thing to call out: we may see a **dip in overall account efficiency** by launching this campaign at a $500/day budget or more. Since Demand Gen focuses on **upper-funnel objectives** like awareness and consideration, we **shouldn’t expect it to perform on the same metrics as Search, Shopping, or PMax.** For that reason, we recommend **reporting on Demand Gen performance separately**, as it will likely contribute to downstream conversions across other campaigns or organic channels.

- **2025-05-14 11:36** *Jake Panzer*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through the weekly **search impression share insights** for **brand** and **non-brand (product) terms** :relaxed:  
  
**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPCs have increased. Corresponds to a rise in impression share by [dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com), [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) and [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com).  
• This could be a result of these **competitors investing heavily** across the board during their **Mother's Day promos**.  
• [dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com) **surpassed the maximum target impression share** we've provided them (20%) last week. Stood at 32%. We recommend **escalating this** to them right away.  
• Finally, [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) has been increasingly bidding on our branded terms and captured the **best impression share among all competitors** last week. We'll keep a close eye here.  
**General non-brand insights**  
• CPCs fell last week but still high.  
• As mentioned in last week's update, we're seeing **CPCs trending up starting from the week of 4/21** which corresponds to increased competition in the ad auction heading into MD.  
• We might notice **higher CPCs** towards the latter part of the month as well due to **increased competition during MDW**  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com)'s impression share rose significantly last week while [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) also managed to increase impression share slightly  
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• Impression share of market leaders like [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) are falling while new brands like [currentbody.ca](http://currentbody.ca), [schoolofdermatology.com](http://schoolofdermatology.com) and [omniluxled.com](http://omniluxled.com) have recently started gaining impression share.  
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• Over the last 2 weeks, we've managed to increase our impression share (which we were losing earlier to others). New copy should help us improve this further.

- **2025-05-22 14:28** *Jake Panzer* 💬 2 replies: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through the weekly **search impression share insights** for **brand** and **non-brand (product) terms.**  
  
**Core Brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPC's have normalized last week as expected, being the week after Mother's Day week  
• **[dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com) still bidding high** on our **brand terms surpassing the max. impression share** we've provided them for the second week in a row. We should ideally escalate ASAP!   
• [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) still having a relatively high impression share  
**Sauna Blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• CPC's have dropped last week as expected, being the week after Mother's Day week. It fell below the general average of ~$3.6 - $4.  
• While we managed to improve our impression share over the last 2 weeks, so has [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com). So did [instyle.com](http://instyle.com) and [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) over last week.  
• We also launched new Sharma ad copy under this non-brand ad group on 5/15 and are hoping to see some good impression share results over the next few weeks.    
**Red Light Hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• CPC's have normalized last week as expected, being the week after Mother's Day week  
• Market leaders [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) managed to improve impression share quite a bit last week along with us.   
**PEMF Mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• CPCs have remained elevated last week, in contrast to other search ad groups, and are likely to stay high this week and the next due to MDW  
• We have lost impression share last week although we were gaining in the previous two weeks (probably due to high spending for MD sale). Competitors like [oxfordmedicals.com](http://oxfordmedicals.com), [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com), [magnawavepemf.com](http://magnawavepemf.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) have gained IS quite a bit last week. To address this, new ad copy will be prioritized for this ad group next week (after the MDW sale). Aiming to share for review by end of next week. cc: @User*7DB7H9 @User*PT7LCE

**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPC's interestingly fell well below average last week!   
• This might be due to several factors:  
    ◦ Competitors like [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) losing impression share  
    ◦ Our impression share improving to over 99%   
    ◦ Last week, despite scaling brand search (along with all other campaigns) for the MDW sale, our spending for core brand terms reduced while clicks increased. This means we drove very efficient brand clicks due to our promo last week.   
• [dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com) is still having an impression share that's higher than 20% for our brand terms (at 32.21%), although, it didn't have much of an impact on our costs last week due to points mentioned above. We'll evaluate their impression share and the impact on our CPCs next week and report back on where they stand and if they are still influencing our brand search costs.  
• Finally, we didn't notice other brands receiving an impression share against our brand terms last week despite running offers with certain retailers.  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• CPCs increased last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• Interestingly, competitor impression share dropped last week and our impression share grew, which was quite a positive trend to see!   
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• CPCs increased last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• Market leaders ([irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com)) as well as HD and [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com), were able to improve impression share last week.  
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• CPCs remained high last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• On a positive note, our impression share grew with scaling and we were able to beat out competitors that were catching up to us the week before last.   
• **New Sharma ad copy for PEMF** aimed at improving ad relevance / quality scores and impression share will be shared for review **this week.** [cc: @User_7DB7H9] This copy will help us maintain a good impression share vs. competitors going into an evergreen period while scaling down campaigns.

- **2025-06-04 14:25** *Jake Panzer*: Hi @Chris Jacob @Ingrid, here's a quick recap from today’s ***Google tag call:***  
• **Google Ads tracking** is confirmed to be working correctly via a test purchase.  
• For **GA4 tracking**, the rep said the current setup is fine, but asked us to check with your dev team / the team that set it up:  
    ◦ If they’re happy with the existing setup and recommend we continue with it. In this case, no further action is needed.  
    ◦ If they prefer / recommend switching to the new Shopify Google &amp; YouTube app setup. In this case, we can proceed—but we’ll need to **remove the current setup** to avoid duplicate conversions *afterwards*.  
Let me know what your team recommends. Also, it's important to not remove any set ups as of now, until we hear back from the team on the above.

- **2025-06-04 15:52** *Jake Panzer* 💬 4 replies: Hey @Ingrid, given the reduced paid media budget this month, we don’t currently have the capacity to test into Demand Gen/YouTube—though we’re definitely eager to explore it, as we believe it has strong potential!  
Right now, the entire Google budget is being used to support existing campaigns, so there’s no room to layer in YouTube within the current allocation.  
Google recommends a **$500/day** minimum for meaningful results (≈**$15K/month**), but if we want to stay budget-conscious, we could start with **$300/day** (≈**$9K/month**).  
Let us know if this incremental budget for YT is possible for June, or if you'd prefer we revisit it next month.  
Thanks! cc: @Ari Murray @Berkeley Clark

• Our impression share dropped off a bit last week (Generally 95%+ but last week it came down to 85%+). This is a result of us scaling down significantly last week to maintain efficiency during the last few days of the sale.   
• No cause for concern here since over the L7D, impression share is once again up to a 97.23% as we returned to an evergreen state.   
• Also happy to report that over the last two weeks, CPCs have trended down vs. evergreen (generally around $3). This could be the impact of us pushing dermstore to reduce bids and budgets for our brand keywords. cc: @Chris Jacob   
**General non-brand insights**  
• CPCs are still high last week vs. evergreen. This was expected due to most MDW sales bleeding into last week (high ad auction competition during MD).   
• We're expecting CPCs to drop off from this week (6/2) as we return to a fully evergreen state.  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• Over the last 4 weeks, [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com) seems to have improved their impression share which could be an indicator that they are bidding more into / scaling into sauna blanket terms, especially during sale periods.   
• Nevertheless, we're still the market leader and we expect to stay at this level as we return to an evergreen state while also having launched new ad copy which seems to be performing better vs. older copy.   
• We'll also ensure to scale if required to maintain our position as the market leader.   
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) still remain market leaders while [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com) also managed to improve their impression share last week, most likely due to high spending during Memorial Day.  
• We're planning on working on new ad copy under this ad group, which should allow us to improve our impression share and catch up to the market leaders during an evergreen state.   
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• We remain as market leaders in the space and are aiming to get copy launched soon (once approved) in order to improve our impression share further over the next few weeks.

- **2025-06-13 07:46** *Jake Panzer*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing this week’s Google Search impression share and CPC update for brand and non-brand (product) terms :blush:  
  
**Core Brand (screenshot 1)**  
• We bounced back from the slight dip in impression share seen during the tail end of the MDW sale, now sitting strong at **97.86%** once again last week (up from 86.19% previous week).  
• What’s even better -- **CPCs dropped further** to **$1.43**, the lowest in over 2 months. This downward CPC trend started in the week of 5/19 and may still be influenced by reduced competition from Dermstore on branded terms. cc: @Chris Jacob  
**Sauna Blanket Non-Brand (screenshot 2)**  
• Our **impression share improved slightly to 38.78%** last week (from 35.08% the previous week), while **CPCs dropped from $5.07 to $3.82**—a positive shift post-sale, as expected, as we head into evergreen.  
• [Hydragun.com](http://Hydragun.com) remains aggressive, still above 30% IS, but we’re continuing to lead. New Sharma copy may be helping us stay in the lead here.  
**Red Light Hat Non-Brand (screenshot 3)**  
• Impression share dipped to **15.53%** last week (vs. 19.04% the previous week), likely from the effects of returning to an evergreen state *with reduced budgets* in June.  
• **CPCs came down slightly** from $7.71 to **$6.90**, which is a step in the right direction post-sale but we expect it to reduce further / normalize over the next few weeks during evergreen.   
**PEMF Mat Non-Brand (screenshot 4)**  
• Holding relatively steady with a **22.10% impression share**, just a minor drop from last week.  
• **CPCs also dropped** to **$5.01**, down from $5.82 post sale, as expected. We expect this to reduce further / normalize over the next few weeks during evergreen.   
• Thanks for approving the new PEMF search copy. Once this is launched, we expect to improve IS and improve our lead against competitors.

**Tiktok Performance L7 (6/16-6/22)**  
1DC Northbeam  
$6,760 (NC)  
ROAS: 0.18 (+251% WoW)  
Revenue: $1,220 (+250% WoW)  
CAC: $2,250 (-66.73% WoW)  
  
Updates and next steps  
• The low AOV product funnel is fully built out and has been spending since Friday  
    ◦ NB shows a .11 roas overall with a .21 roas in the retargeting ad group. This has started off slowly and we’re making adjustments this week. If we do not see significant improvement by the end of the week we’ll look to end this test   
• Our next test is to focus heavily on the high aov products as opposed to the low aov ones and segment these out closely  
• We are preparing to move body sculpt to a conversion focused campaign in July as well. The traffic campaign has been excellent so far with a .22 CPC and a CTR of 2.62.

- **2025-06-24 10:24** *Jake Panzer*: Hey @Jourdan, these are the **"platform comparable"** metrics I was referring to, which are available for Demand Gen campaigns *only*. For these columns, conversions are attributed in a similar way to how paid social platforms like Meta attributes conversions, which gives a better picture on the true performance/impact of a Demand Gen campaigns.

**Core Brand - Screenshot 1**  
• Impression share dropped to 91.91% in week 6/9. Correlates to scaling down post Father's Day sale on Jun 10.   
• Rose to **94.40% last week** most likely as a response to scaling back up based on Google rep recommendations   
• Staying strong above 90% for 7 of the past 8 weeks.  
• CPCs remain very efficient at **$1.68**, down significantly from early May highs. It has been under $2 since week 5/19 -- correlates to when dermstore confirmed they've been bidding less on our brand terms.   
• Key competitors (**Dermstore**, **Hydragun**) have pulled back / lost impression share over the last couple of weeks.  
• Amazon however increased their impression share over the last 2 weeks  
• Brand terms are well-defended with low CPCs, high impression share :white*check*mark:  
**Sauna Blanket (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 2**  
• Impression share rose to **33.41% last week**, recovering slightly from previous week’s dip -- most likely due to scaling down in week 6/9 and scaling back up in week 6/16.  
• CPCs dropped to **$4.66 last week**, down from $5.38 (Father's Day Sale week, 5/9) — a good sign of improving efficiency during an evergreen state although it hasn't reached true evergreen levels yet.  
• **Hydragun** remains our main competitor but is also trending down. **Amazon** managed to gain impression share over the last two weeks.  
• We have a decent lead, but still below May peak. This is most likely as we've scaled down dramatically in June.   
**Red Light Hat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 3**  
• **iRestore** and **Kiierr** continue to dominate the space.  
• Our share edged up to **11.41% last week**, but still far below the **31%** peak in week 5/9, likely due to scaling down significantly in June.  
• CPCs improved to **$6.08 last week**, down from over $10 in week 4/28. Slowly stabilizing post sales although it hasn't reached true evergreen levels yet.   
• **New Red Light Hat search copy** was launched this week and we expect to see an improvement in our share over the next few weeks.   
**PEMF Mat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 4**  
• Slight rise in share to **21.43% last week**, but still below earlier highs. Competitors, **Magnawavepemf** and **Healthnews** gaining ground. Likely due to scaling down significantly in June.  
• **New PEMF search copy** launched this week and we expect to see an improvement in our share over the next few weeks. We should also ideally think of scaling here to recapture impression share.   
• CPCs stable at **$5.05**, within recent averages. \n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.18.16 PM.png** (png, 418.2KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093F0GP329/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.18.16_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.18.51 PM.png** (png, 505.5KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093WFE289X/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.18.51_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.19.14 PM.png** (png, 550.7KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093F0H9W2Z/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.19.14_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.19.34 PM.png** (png, 524.0KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093BF2SGQN/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.19.34_pm.png)

**ROAS: .13** (-35.58%)  
**CAC: $3,100 (+30.90%)**   
Updates and next steps  
• The body sculpt focused funnel has started off well both in platform and in NB.  
    ◦ In platform: 4.54 ROAS $73 CAC  
    ◦ NB clicks only: .68 ROAS   
    ◦ Awareness metrics: 62.3% LP view rate, .72 CPC. We will look to refresh this campaign to keep driving these metrics   
• In the pipeline is our full high aov product funnel  
    ◦ We'll launch this if body sculpt falls off/budget supports!  
Traffic campaigns in June (Roughly 12% of spend this week)  
• .35 CPC, 1.56% CTR and a Landing page view rate 66.14%  
[Creative Report](https://projects.motionapp.com/snapshot/1c57f4ef-091a-473c-9802-ac496beffacb)  
• 027 V4 is our top performer in platform and on NB. The sound and text overlay are both key factors here. The background sound is consistent in the top performing body sculpt creatives 
- **2025-07-09 09:09** *Jake Panzer*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through our **search impression share and CPC insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms.  
  
**Core Brand - Screenshot 1**  
• Defending brand terms very well with an impression share consistently over 90%, over the last 8+ weeks.  
• [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) have increased impression share over the last 4 weeks, indicating higher bidding on our brand terms.   
**Sauna Blanket (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 2**  
• Defending market share well - still the market leader. [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) is our main competitor in the space.   
• CPCs seem to be normalizing over the last 3 weeks, showcasing a slow return to an evergreen state  
**Red Light Hat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 3**  
• Market leaders [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) have seen a significant drop in impression share over the last 2 weeks. Possibly due to scaling down drastically post promos. Showcases a need to scale significantly during sale periods to remain competitive with them.  
• Competitors like [schoolofdermatology.com](http://schoolofdermatology.com) and [omniluxled.com](http://omniluxled.com) have managed to improve their share in the space and a new competitor has entered the auction house ([hoogahealth.com](http://hoogahealth.com))   
• We want to scale this campaign by 20% this week to assess if we can capture some additional impression share, traffic and conversions.   
**PEMF Mat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 4**  
• We remain market leaders in the space despite scaling down drastically in June. This indicates strong performance during evergreen periods. We also recently launched new ad copy under the PEMF ad group aimed at improving quality scores and impression share which seems to be working well in defending our share.   
• [magnawavepemf.com](http://magnawavepemf.com) remains our biggest competitor in the space.   
• CPCs are dropping / stabilizing, indicating a slow return to an evergreen state.

- **2025-07-10 09:20** *Jake Panzer* 💬 5 replies: Hey @Ingrid (cc: @Jourdan), we met with our Google rep Tori yesterday and here’s what we aligned on—sharing for visibility:  
• We’ll let the **Pmax scaling test** run for 30 days (from June 19 until July 18), then scale down any campaigns that aren’t driving incremental revenue post scale.  
 • On July 12 (after Prime Day), we’ll **increase the target ROAS** on one Pmax campaign by +15% and monitor for around 2 weeks before deciding whether to roll this out to other campaigns.  
 • **Demand Gen scaling to $500/day** will realistically need about 6 weeks for proper learning according to Tori. Let us know if you guys are down to up the budget to $500/day from the current $300/day.  
 • Waiting on Tori to confirm what the **ToF YT Reach/Traffic investment** will look like.

- **2025-07-10 10:58** *Jake Panzer*: Hey @Jourdan and team, our Shopping campaign has had a bit of drop off in spends and revenue recently, so I did a little digging and noticed that *bundles* were the primary cause. I believe the bundle images which are synced to GMC showcases the evergreen offer, and because of this, GMC has disapproved those SKUs as promotional imagery is not allowed in Google Shopping placements. Would you guys be able to provide <mailto:rahul@sharmabrands.com|rahul@sharmabrands.com> and <mailto:berkeley@sharmabrands.com|berkeley@sharmabrands.com> admin access to your GMC, and also provide us alternate image links for each bundle that's live on-site, which doesn't showcase the offer?  
Thanks in advance!

- **2025-07-15 13:51** *Jake Panzer*: Hey @Ingrid @Jourdan @Chris Jacob, more good news! I've managed to get most of our bundles approved on GMC, which were previously flagged as having promotional imagery and were disapproved. The fix of adding a supplemental feed with the new image links (without the promo stickers) worked :relaxed:  
  
The Sauna Blanket Starter Kit is still disapproved but I have requested a review from GMC. Will keep an eye here and let you guys know once it's approved too.  
  
I also noticed that the Summer Travel Glow Kit is missing on GMC. I can work on getting it added although I might need some clarity as to who manages the current product feeds on GMC. I've attached a screenshot of the feeds (data sources) connected to GMC. Once I know who currently manages them, I can work closely with them to get the new bundle added and make any further optis.

Would love to get a quick call on the books with you this week to walk through the current feed setup so I can get fully caught up.

- **2025-07-18 12:07** *Jake Panzer* 💬 11 replies: Hey @Jourdan @Ingrid – sharing a quick update on the ***PMax scaling test***, since today marks the end of the 30-day test window (June 19 to July 17).  
  
*Overall, scaling results look promising.*  
**Here’s a breakdown based on *Northbeam 1DC data* (Jun 19–Jul 17 vs. previous period):**  
• *Non-Brand PEMF PMax* up 131% in revenue | 1.68 ROAS (+20%) | *NB 1DC*  
• *Non-Brand Sauna Blanket PMax* up 40% in revenue | 1.60 ROAS (-33%) | *NB 1DC*  
• *Non-Brand Red Light PMax* up 43% in revenue | 1.58 ROAS (+1%) | *NB 1DC*  
Note: The previous period included the *Body Sculptor launch and Father’s Day sale*, so we’re comparing against an inflated baseline.  
  
**From *Google in-platform data for Pmax* (Jun 19–Jul 10 vs. previous period):**  
• Impressions up 19%  
• Clicks up +35%  
• CTR up +14%  
• CPV down -14%  
• Revenue down -41% (likely due to the stronger comparison period)  
The drop in CPV supports what Google mentioned about PMax leaning more into *Top-of-Funnel placements like YouTube*, which helps build awareness efficiently.  
  
***Recommendation:***  
Let’s maintain current PMax budget levels, given the incremental revenue in 3 of the 5 scaled campaigns and clear improvements in traffic quality.  
  
***Budget note*** cc: @Jourdan @Ingrid:  
We’re currently pacing about **$30K over the $100K Google budget** for July. This was expected, as we committed to running the **30-day PMax scaling test** through its full cycle.  
We’ve noticed that the **influencer platform is under-pacing** against July budgets. Let us know if we can reallocate from there to help absorb the Google overage.  
If you’d like us to **scale further into top-performing PMax campaigns**, we’re happy to — but we’d need an **additional ~$2,800** for the rest of the month to do so.  
Let us know how you'd like us to move forward.  
Thanks! cc: @Berkeley Clark @Rahul @Ari Murray
- **2025-07-18 13:29** *Jourdan*: Hey @Jake Panzer thank you for the update and all the context that’s super helpful.  
  
We’re still down 9% YoY and since Google is the primary channel we don’t want to pull back if anything I want to keep pushing budgets on Google since we’re down 23% in spend Last 7.  
  
Do you have insights into why budget is pulling back?  
  
  
CC: @Rahul I also see some under performing campaigns on Meta like PEMF and Sauna Blanket that we could reduce spend on, shift budget to other performing campaigns, or shift the budget to google.  
  
I’d love to know both of your thoughts so we can keep pushing revenue up.  
  
I know we’re up against a few challenges compared to last year but we’re not too far behind on rev.\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*

The wholesale is lumpy because we don't get clean sell through data for everyone so a lot of data is based on when we large/bulk ship a PO

- **2025-04-10 11:58** *Chris Jacob*: <!channel> i took a prescheduled call with Northbeam reps  
• They are available to Sharma for whatever if rollover help is needed  
• They are still failing to correctly clear out $0 order (we use for marketing comps and warranty replacements)  
• This affects anything in NB that relies on order count like AOV
- **2025-04-10 12:02** *User_VC4WJH* 💬 3 replies: @Chris Jacob We would love to attend that call and help move things along! We can also shoot through an urgent message right now to reps on our side to see if we can get the $0 orders resolved more quickly.
- **2025-04-10 15:40** *Chris Jacob*: <!channel> related to call just now it would be helpful to see if any info (even if imperfect) we have to date - few months of Northbeam, Motion, whatever - can inform any sense of the relative costs of converting into a sale of different products  
  
I have little notion of this and I think it can help inform a lot because, as examples  
• Blanket and Go Mat are same priced products - but very different maturity, ability for customer to understand, etc - what's our relative cost to convert?  
• A Pro Mat drops 3.2x a mask to the bottom line - I doubt it costs 3x spend to convert but even if it does the contribution margin gap is enormous

• Strong week in performance with ROAS and CAC both improving heavily in the account which resulted in a 14% revenue increase.  
• The main contributor in terms of revenue gained in the account was the Red Light Products ASC and the following ad drove home nearly 50% of attributed revenue for the campaign.  
    ◦ ***Ad**: MULT | VID | 16-20s VID | Lifestyle | Light | Red Light Hat | 040125 | Hat on the Go | PDP*  
• In terms of ROAS, the volume DABA campaign lead the way with a 8.24x ROAS.  
• This is a trend we are seeing in the Meta accounts recently where catalog ads are performing at a very high efficiency level compared to normal ad sets. With this in mind, we are looking at scaling where possible to keep up with the momentum.  
• Net new actions taken this week was the launch of the TOF Sauna Blanket creative testing campaign. Along with the Oprah ads, we are launching the first set of SB ads into this campaign today.  
• Along with this, we are also going to be launching the Red Light TOF creative testing campaign today too, heading into the weekend.  
[Best Performing Creative](https://projects.motionapp.com/snapshot/67f944b0c76352823f443bd1)  
• The DPA’s continued to have strong performance and the top 8 ads that spent over $750 L7 had a good mix of statics and videos.

Summary of optis:  
• Updated campaign objectives to "Sales" across Brand and Non-Brand Search to better align with performance goals.  
• Switched bidding strategies of two Brand Search campaigns to automated bidding across to drive scale.  
• Paused the underperforming Brand Sale ad group (0 revenue L60D) under US*Brand*Core campaign  
• Scaled budgets across top-performing campaigns to capture incremental revenue:  
    ◦ +10% on PMax Brand All Products &amp; PMax Non-Brand Sauna Blanket  
    ◦ +20% on PMax Brand Consumables &amp; PMax Non-Brand PEMF  
    ◦ +20% on Non-Brand Products Search  
• Reduced budget on PMax Non-Brand Red Light by 20% due to underperformance  
• Scaled down the three main Brand Search campaigns by 20% to assess top-line revenue impact.  
• Optimized all non-brand campaigns to bid exclusively on new customers (vs. just bidding higher).  
• Excluded brand terms from non-brand search campaigns.  
• Further scaled down US*PMax*NonBrand*RedLight by 20% — previous Apr 4 scale-down drove ROAS improvement without impacting revenue.  
• Paused poor-performing keywords in US*NonBrand*Concern that spent significantly without generating meaningful revenue over the last 60 days.  
• Paused low-performing ad in NonBrand*Concern*RedLightMask ad group to prioritize top-performing creative.

Actions taken and points for next week  
• Turned off underperformers in original SPC. Leaving only the top performers there to get everything we can out of them  
• Duped the SPC and kept only the creatives that had not gotten any spend to test if any of those are winners  
• Checked for usage rights and turned off the expired one  
• Working with Chandler and Blake to kickoff shop on the right foot. Would love to get something on the calendar with them for intros and learning  
• Start building true campaign structure as we get creative in

- **2025-04-14 16:11** *Ingrid*: Also, I'm worried we are not spending enough to meet/exceed those LY numbers - my suggestion is spending more on Meta where we have an efficient ROAS to at least 10% more than we spent last year.

- **2025-04-16 10:50** *User_GR9M7E*: Hey @Ingrid, apologies for the delay in sending this through but here's the **non-brand search impression share by product** along w/ some insights to consider.  
  
**Screenshot 1 -  Sauna Blanket**  
• CPCs hovering around $3 - $4  
• Our impression share is the best in the space and is around 30% on average  
• With new ad copy coming in, designed to improve strength and keyword-relevance, we're hoping to see impression share grow further.   
**Screenshot 2 -  Red Light Hat**  
• CPCs hovering around $4.5 - $8. Slightly volatile. More competitors in the space  
• There was a hike in CPCs during the week of Mar 3 - Mar 24. The green competitor ([illumiflow.com](http://illumiflow.com)) seems to have had an impact there.   
• More importantly, the red competitor ([irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com)) has had higher impression share in the red light hat space consistently, so we'll be taking a few pointers from them for our new hat search ad copy.   
**Screenshot 3 -  PEMF**   
• CPCs hovering around a $3.70- $4.40. Seeing a rise from week of Mar 24 - Apr 7.  
• We're slowly starting to loose impression share while Amazon is slowly gaining.   
• For our new PEMF search ad copy, we'll be sure to take some pointers from amazon.   
Let me know if you have any thoughts / insights I might've missed. Thank you!

- **2025-04-18 12:36** *User_TS27JN*: Hey @Ingrid happy Friday! Two quick questions for you. Performance has been good on the platform and in order to test creatives fully and continue growth we'd like to increase our daily budget. We have kept where it was before taking over, but would love to have the go ahead for another $350 in daily spend (we are currently around $825 daily). That would add $4200 to the tiktok monthly budget for april. Second, I know we spoke about making sure the copy matches the creatives yesterday. While using this current campaign type tiktok assigns the copy and given its performance we would like to avoid shutting it down. With your permission we'd like to leave this one live and have our team whip up some more evergreen copy for the future!

- **2025-04-29 10:21** *User_TS27JN*: Hi @Ingrid and team here are Tiktok updates for the week. We did a look back of MoM as opposed to YoY due to the low spend in 2024.  
High level updates:  
• Chris is planning to upload category authorization documentation for shop. We will take over effectively completely from there in terms of set up and shop ad management. Affiliate split to come as we continue building the account and are in a stable place shop wise.   
Whats next:  
• Our plan is to test 2-3 creative ideas at a time at a high spend as opposed to spreading the account thin given high CAC high AOV.  This will help us be more intentional about learnings and hopefully speed up that process. While we do creative test the account will continue seeing performance fluctuation.   
    ◦ With that we are building a testing schedule for easy visibility/tracking (this will include various campaign types including manual, SPC, and search as well as the creative testing idea itself). We'll provide benchmarks for each test in this doc too.   
• We are slowly testing and phasing out the non sparked SPCs as creative fatigues, but definitely want to take advantage of some really great creative currently in the account while we can (heavy sauna blanket before it goes out of season completely).   
Thank you and have a great rest of your week! CC @User_VC4WJH\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-04-29 at 11.09.48 AM.png** (png, 93.8KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F08Q8UEG5GS/screenshot_2025-04-29_at_11.09.48___am.png)
- **2025-04-30 10:39** *User_TS27JN*: Good morning @Ingrid! We'd like to really lean in to the sale on tiktok without jeopardizing the learnings currently happening in the account. Would it be possible to have a dedicated $750 daily budget towards the sale during this period (and next sale period!) and return back to the normal budget after? For this week that would be an additional ~$3750 in spend. If we see performance tick up we can ping as well! Let me know what you think. Thank you!

- **2025-05-05 09:24** *Chris Jacob*: working on it
- **2025-05-05 11:09** *User_GR9M7E*: Hi @Ingrid, we wanted to share this with you directly before looping in the broader email thread with the Google reps. In short, we don't recommend scaling too much further in this time, given where we are at with efficiency. Often, we find reps try to push the limits of spend, so wanted to share the numbers below:  
  
• Last year (Apr 19–24, 2024), during the first six days of the Mother’s Day Sale, we spent $31,565.29 and generated $215,841.11 in revenue for a **ROAS of 6.84 and CPA of $92.53.**  
• This year (Apr 29–May 4, 2025), we spent $58,063.39 (+84% YoY) and drove $306,123.38 in revenue (+42% YoY), with a ROAS of 5.27 (-23% YoY) and a CPA of $110.72 (+20% YoY). These figures include late attribution.  
With scaling thus far, we've achieved incremental revenue at reduced efficiency. However, if we push further we would be risking an even lower ROAS and higher CAC and in this case, we would recommend holding steady with spend today or finding a middle ground.  
  
We also don't recommend maintaining elevated budgets after the initial sales phase ends as we expect efficiency to drop dramatically, but will hike back up again over next weekend. Let us know if you are aligned here - or prefer to push forward for topline growth in this time.  
Thanks!

- **2025-05-06 14:25** *User_TS27JN*: Hey @Ingrid had an interesting callout regarding tiktok during the sale period. We increased spend during this period, however we saw a legitimate incremental rise in sessions during this time. This just continues to confirm the idea of tiktok's lift into other channels as opposed to purely in platform purchases.

**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPCs hovering in the normal range ~$3  
• Amazon's impression share rose quite significantly last week. This might be due to heavy investment on brand terms during the Mother's Day Sale but we're eager to hear your insights here  
• Dermstore's impression share stands at 15.21% (below than the max target of 20% we've given them) although it did increase slightly WoW  
**General non-brand insights**   
• CPC's have spiked quite a bit last week for non-brand / product terms, especially against the red light hat. We believe that this might be an impact due to heavy competition / investment during the Mother's Day Sale period.   
• We'll report back by next week on whether CPCs normalize but we think there might be a few weeks of high CPCs due to the sale season this month (Mother's Day and Memorial Day)  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• We managed to improve impression share last week along with [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com) despite rising CPCs  
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• Our impression share has consistently been low in this space. We're aiming to share new ad copy for review by early next week in order to combat this  
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• We managed to increase our impression share last week which were slowly losing in previous weeks.

- **2025-05-08 15:11** *User_GR9M7E* 💬 4 replies: Hi @Ingrid, we’ve connected with our Google reps, Tori and Casey, regarding a preliminary **Demand Gen (YouTube) investment plan.** While their initial recommendation was a $100K/month budget ($3,333/day) to drive statistically significant learnings, we flagged that as outside our scope and asked for a more realistic alternative.  
They’ve since shared the attached plan, which outlines a "crawl, walk, run" approach to budget scaling. While our original recommendation was $7,500/month ($250/day), the minimum viable spend in their framework—the “crawl” scenario—is set at **$15K/month ($500/day).** Given this is the **lowest tier that still ensures meaningful learnings,** we believe it makes sense to move forward at that level.  
In terms of **performance measurement,** Google suggested methods such as a **search lift study (only eligible at a $1000/day budget) and accounting for view-through conversions** among other things, which are outlined in the **“Holistic Measurement Framework”** section of their plan.  
One thing to call out: we may see a **dip in overall account efficiency** by launching this campaign at a $500/day budget or more. Since Demand Gen focuses on **upper-funnel objectives** like awareness and consideration, we **shouldn’t expect it to perform on the same metrics as Search, Shopping, or PMax.** For that reason, we recommend **reporting on Demand Gen performance separately**, as it will likely contribute to downstream conversions across other campaigns or organic channels.

- **2025-05-14 11:36** *User_GR9M7E*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through the weekly **search impression share insights** for **brand** and **non-brand (product) terms** :relaxed:  
  
**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPCs have increased. Corresponds to a rise in impression share by [dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com), [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) and [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com).  
• This could be a result of these **competitors investing heavily** across the board during their **Mother's Day promos**.  
• [dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com) **surpassed the maximum target impression share** we've provided them (20%) last week. Stood at 32%. We recommend **escalating this** to them right away.  
• Finally, [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) has been increasingly bidding on our branded terms and captured the **best impression share among all competitors** last week. We'll keep a close eye here.  
**General non-brand insights**  
• CPCs fell last week but still high.  
• As mentioned in last week's update, we're seeing **CPCs trending up starting from the week of 4/21** which corresponds to increased competition in the ad auction heading into MD.  
• We might notice **higher CPCs** towards the latter part of the month as well due to **increased competition during MDW**  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com)'s impression share rose significantly last week while [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) also managed to increase impression share slightly  
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• Impression share of market leaders like [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) are falling while new brands like [currentbody.ca](http://currentbody.ca), [schoolofdermatology.com](http://schoolofdermatology.com) and [omniluxled.com](http://omniluxled.com) have recently started gaining impression share.  
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• Over the last 2 weeks, we've managed to increase our impression share (which we were losing earlier to others). New copy should help us improve this further.

**Core Brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPC's have normalized last week as expected, being the week after Mother's Day week  
• **[dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com) still bidding high** on our **brand terms surpassing the max. impression share** we've provided them for the second week in a row. We should ideally escalate ASAP!   
• [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) still having a relatively high impression share  
**Sauna Blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• CPC's have dropped last week as expected, being the week after Mother's Day week. It fell below the general average of ~$3.6 - $4.  
• While we managed to improve our impression share over the last 2 weeks, so has [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com). So did [instyle.com](http://instyle.com) and [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) over last week.  
• We also launched new Sharma ad copy under this non-brand ad group on 5/15 and are hoping to see some good impression share results over the next few weeks.    
**Red Light Hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• CPC's have normalized last week as expected, being the week after Mother's Day week  
• Market leaders [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) managed to improve impression share quite a bit last week along with us.   
**PEMF Mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• CPCs have remained elevated last week, in contrast to other search ad groups, and are likely to stay high this week and the next due to MDW  
• We have lost impression share last week although we were gaining in the previous two weeks (probably due to high spending for MD sale). Competitors like [oxfordmedicals.com](http://oxfordmedicals.com), [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com), [magnawavepemf.com](http://magnawavepemf.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) have gained IS quite a bit last week. To address this, new ad copy will be prioritized for this ad group next week (after the MDW sale). Aiming to share for review by end of next week. cc: @User*7DB7H9 @User*PT7LCE

**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPC's interestingly fell well below average last week!   
• This might be due to several factors:  
    ◦ Competitors like [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) losing impression share  
    ◦ Our impression share improving to over 99%   
    ◦ Last week, despite scaling brand search (along with all other campaigns) for the MDW sale, our spending for core brand terms reduced while clicks increased. This means we drove very efficient brand clicks due to our promo last week.   
• [dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com) is still having an impression share that's higher than 20% for our brand terms (at 32.21%), although, it didn't have much of an impact on our costs last week due to points mentioned above. We'll evaluate their impression share and the impact on our CPCs next week and report back on where they stand and if they are still influencing our brand search costs.  
• Finally, we didn't notice other brands receiving an impression share against our brand terms last week despite running offers with certain retailers.  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• CPCs increased last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• Interestingly, competitor impression share dropped last week and our impression share grew, which was quite a positive trend to see!   
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• CPCs increased last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• Market leaders ([irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com)) as well as HD and [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com), were able to improve impression share last week.  
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• CPCs remained high last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• On a positive note, our impression share grew with scaling and we were able to beat out competitors that were catching up to us the week before last.   
• **New Sharma ad copy for PEMF** aimed at improving ad relevance / quality scores and impression share will be shared for review **this week.** [cc: @User*7DB7H9] This copy will help us maintain a good impression share vs. competitors going into an evergreen period while scaling down campaigns.

- **2025-06-04 14:25** *User_GR9M7E*: Hi @Chris Jacob @Ingrid, here's a quick recap from today’s ***Google tag call:***  
• **Google Ads tracking** is confirmed to be working correctly via a test purchase.  
• For **GA4 tracking**, the rep said the current setup is fine, but asked us to check with your dev team / the team that set it up:  
    ◦ If they’re happy with the existing setup and recommend we continue with it. In this case, no further action is needed.  
    ◦ If they prefer / recommend switching to the new Shopify Google &amp; YouTube app setup. In this case, we can proceed—but we’ll need to **remove the current setup** to avoid duplicate conversions *afterwards*.  
Let me know what your team recommends. Also, it's important to not remove any set ups as of now, until we hear back from the team on the above.

- **2025-06-04 15:52** *User_GR9M7E* 💬 4 replies: Hey @Ingrid, given the reduced paid media budget this month, we don’t currently have the capacity to test into Demand Gen/YouTube—though we’re definitely eager to explore it, as we believe it has strong potential!  
Right now, the entire Google budget is being used to support existing campaigns, so there’s no room to layer in YouTube within the current allocation.  
Google recommends a **$500/day** minimum for meaningful results (≈**$15K/month**), but if we want to stay budget-conscious, we could start with **$300/day** (≈**$9K/month**).  
Let us know if this incremental budget for YT is possible for June, or if you'd prefer we revisit it next month.  
Thanks! cc: @User*D39C0Z @User*VC4WJH
- **2025-06-05 09:58** *User_GR9M7E*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through the weekly **search impression share insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms :relaxed:  
  
**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• Our impression share dropped off a bit last week (Generally 95%+ but last week it came down to 85%+). This is a result of us scaling down significantly last week to maintain efficiency during the last few days of the sale.   
• No cause for concern here since over the L7D, impression share is once again up to a 97.23% as we returned to an evergreen state.   
• Also happy to report that over the last two weeks, CPCs have trended down vs. evergreen (generally around $3). This could be the impact of us pushing dermstore to reduce bids and budgets for our brand keywords. cc: @Chris Jacob   
**General non-brand insights**  
• CPCs are still high last week vs. evergreen. This was expected due to most MDW sales bleeding into last week (high ad auction competition during MD).   
• We're expecting CPCs to drop off from this week (6/2) as we return to a fully evergreen state.  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• Over the last 4 weeks, [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com) seems to have improved their impression share which could be an indicator that they are bidding more into / scaling into sauna blanket terms, especially during sale periods.   
• Nevertheless, we're still the market leader and we expect to stay at this level as we return to an evergreen state while also having launched new ad copy which seems to be performing better vs. older copy.   
• We'll also ensure to scale if required to maintain our position as the market leader.   
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) still remain market leaders while [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com) also managed to improve their impression share last week, most likely due to high spending during Memorial Day.  
• We're planning on working on new ad copy under this ad group, which should allow us to improve our impression share and catch up to the market leaders during an evergreen state.   
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• We remain as market leaders in the space and are aiming to get copy launched soon (once approved) in order to improve our impression share further over the next few weeks.

- **2025-06-13 07:46** *User_GR9M7E*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing this week’s Google Search impression share and CPC update for brand and non-brand (product) terms :blush:  
  
**Core Brand (screenshot 1)**  
• We bounced back from the slight dip in impression share seen during the tail end of the MDW sale, now sitting strong at **97.86%** once again last week (up from 86.19% previous week).  
• What’s even better -- **CPCs dropped further** to **$1.43**, the lowest in over 2 months. This downward CPC trend started in the week of 5/19 and may still be influenced by reduced competition from Dermstore on branded terms. cc: @Chris Jacob  
**Sauna Blanket Non-Brand (screenshot 2)**  
• Our **impression share improved slightly to 38.78%** last week (from 35.08% the previous week), while **CPCs dropped from $5.07 to $3.82**—a positive shift post-sale, as expected, as we head into evergreen.  
• [Hydragun.com](http://Hydragun.com) remains aggressive, still above 30% IS, but we’re continuing to lead. New Sharma copy may be helping us stay in the lead here.  
**Red Light Hat Non-Brand (screenshot 3)**  
• Impression share dipped to **15.53%** last week (vs. 19.04% the previous week), likely from the effects of returning to an evergreen state *with reduced budgets* in June.  
• **CPCs came down slightly** from $7.71 to **$6.90**, which is a step in the right direction post-sale but we expect it to reduce further / normalize over the next few weeks during evergreen.   
**PEMF Mat Non-Brand (screenshot 4)**  
• Holding relatively steady with a **22.10% impression share**, just a minor drop from last week.  
• **CPCs also dropped** to **$5.01**, down from $5.82 post sale, as expected. We expect this to reduce further / normalize over the next few weeks during evergreen.   
• Thanks for approving the new PEMF search copy. Once this is launched, we expect to improve IS and improve our lead against competitors.

- **2025-06-24 10:04** *User_TS27JN*: Hi team- we ran out of time today, so here are our tiktok updates for the last week!  
  
**Tiktok Performance L7 (6/16-6/22)**  
1DC Northbeam  
$6,760 (NC)  
ROAS: 0.18 (+251% WoW)  
Revenue: $1,220 (+250% WoW)  
CAC: $2,250 (-66.73% WoW)  
  
Updates and next steps  
• The low AOV product funnel is fully built out and has been spending since Friday  
    ◦ NB shows a .11 roas overall with a .21 roas in the retargeting ad group. This has started off slowly and we’re making adjustments this week. If we do not see significant improvement by the end of the week we’ll look to end this test   
• Our next test is to focus heavily on the high aov products as opposed to the low aov ones and segment these out closely  
• We are preparing to move body sculpt to a conversion focused campaign in July as well. The traffic campaign has been excellent so far with a .22 CPC and a CTR of 2.62.

For these columns, conversions are attributed in a similar way to how paid social platforms like Meta attributes conversions, which gives a better picture on the true performance/impact of a Demand Gen campaigns.

- **2025-06-28 05:29** *User_GR9M7E* 💬 2 replies: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, apologies for the delay here. Sharing through our weekly **search impression share insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms.  
  
**Core Brand - Screenshot 1**  
• Impression share dropped to 91.91% in week 6/9. Correlates to scaling down post Father's Day sale on Jun 10.   
• Rose to **94.40% last week** most likely as a response to scaling back up based on Google rep recommendations   
• Staying strong above 90% for 7 of the past 8 weeks.  
• CPCs remain very efficient at **$1.68**, down significantly from early May highs. It has been under $2 since week 5/19 -- correlates to when dermstore confirmed they've been bidding less on our brand terms.   
• Key competitors (**Dermstore**, **Hydragun**) have pulled back / lost impression share over the last couple of weeks.  
• Amazon however increased their impression share over the last 2 weeks  
• Brand terms are well-defended with low CPCs, high impression share :white*check*mark:  
**Sauna Blanket (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 2**  
• Impression share rose to **33.41% last week**, recovering slightly from previous week’s dip -- most likely due to scaling down in week 6/9 and scaling back up in week 6/16.  
• CPCs dropped to **$4.66 last week**, down from $5.38 (Father's Day Sale week, 5/9) — a good sign of improving efficiency during an evergreen state although it hasn't reached true evergreen levels yet.  
• **Hydragun** remains our main competitor but is also trending down. **Amazon** managed to gain impression share over the last two weeks.  
• We have a decent lead, but still below May peak. This is most likely as we've scaled down dramatically in June.   
**Red Light Hat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 3**  
• **iRestore** and **Kiierr** continue to dominate the space.  
• Our share edged up to **11.41% last week**, but still far below the **31%** peak in week 5/9, likely due to scaling down significantly in June.  
• CPCs improved to **$6.08 last week**, down from over $10 in week 4/28. Slowly stabilizing post sales although it hasn't reached true evergreen levels yet.   
• **New Red Light Hat search copy** was launched this week and we expect to see an improvement in our share over the next few weeks.   
**PEMF Mat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 4**  
• Slight rise in share to **21.43% last week**, but still below earlier highs. Competitors, **Magnawavepemf** and **Healthnews** gaining ground. Likely due to scaling down significantly in June.  
• **New PEMF search copy** launched this week and we expect to see an improvement in our share over the next few weeks. We should also ideally think of scaling here to recapture impression share.   
• CPCs stable at **$5.05**, within recent averages. \n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.18.16 PM.png** (png, 418.2KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093F0GP329/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.18.16_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.18.51 PM.png** (png, 505.5KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093WFE289X/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.18.51_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.19.14 PM.png** (png, 550.7KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093F0H9W2Z/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.19.14_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.19.34 PM.png** (png, 524.0KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093BF2SGQN/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.19.34_pm.png)

**Spend: $6,200**  
**Revenue: $804**  
**ROAS: .13** (-35.58%)  
**CAC: $3,100 (+30.90%)**   
Updates and next steps  
• The body sculpt focused funnel has started off well both in platform and in NB.  
    ◦ In platform: 4.54 ROAS $73 CAC  
    ◦ NB clicks only: .68 ROAS   
    ◦ Awareness metrics: 62.3% LP view rate, .72 CPC. We will look to refresh this campaign to keep driving these metrics   
• In the pipeline is our full high aov product funnel  
    ◦ We'll launch this if body sculpt falls off/budget supports!  
Traffic campaigns in June (Roughly 12% of spend this week)  
• .35 CPC, 1.56% CTR and a Landing page view rate 66.14%  
[Creative Report](https://projects.motionapp.com/snapshot/1c57f4ef-091a-473c-9802-ac496beffacb)  
• 027 V4 is our top performer in platform and on NB. The sound and text overlay are both key factors here. The background sound is consistent in the top performing body sculpt creatives 
- **2025-07-09 09:09** *User_GR9M7E*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through our **search impression share and CPC insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms.  
  
**Core Brand - Screenshot 1**  
• Defending brand terms very well with an impression share consistently over 90%, over the last 8+ weeks.  
• [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) have increased impression share over the last 4 weeks, indicating higher bidding on our brand terms.   
**Sauna Blanket (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 2**  
• Defending market share well - still the market leader. [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) is our main competitor in the space.   
• CPCs seem to be normalizing over the last 3 weeks, showcasing a slow return to an evergreen state  
**Red Light Hat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 3**  
• Market leaders [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) have seen a significant drop in impression share over the last 2 weeks. Possibly due to scaling down drastically post promos. Showcases a need to scale significantly during sale periods to remain competitive with them.  
• Competitors like [schoolofdermatology.com](http://schoolofdermatology.com) and [omniluxled.com](http://omniluxled.com) have managed to improve their share in the space and a new competitor has entered the auction house ([hoogahealth.com](http://hoogahealth.com))   
• We want to scale this campaign by 20% this week to assess if we can capture some additional impression share, traffic and conversions.   
**PEMF Mat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 4**  
• We remain market leaders in the space despite scaling down drastically in June. This indicates strong performance during evergreen periods. We also recently launched new ad copy under the PEMF ad group aimed at improving quality scores and impression share which seems to be working well in defending our share.   
• [magnawavepemf.com](http://magnawavepemf.com) remains our biggest competitor in the space.   
• CPCs are dropping / stabilizing, indicating a slow return to an evergreen state.

- **2025-07-10 09:20** *User_GR9M7E* 💬 5 replies: Hey @Ingrid (cc: @Jourdan), we met with our Google rep Tori yesterday and here’s what we aligned on—sharing for visibility:  
• We’ll let the **Pmax scaling test** run for 30 days (from June 19 until July 18), then scale down any campaigns that aren’t driving incremental revenue post scale.  
 • On July 12 (after Prime Day), we’ll **increase the target ROAS** on one Pmax campaign by +15% and monitor for around 2 weeks before deciding whether to roll this out to other campaigns.  
 • **Demand Gen scaling to $500/day** will realistically need about 6 weeks for proper learning according to Tori. Let us know if you guys are down to up the budget to $500/day from the current $300/day.  
 • Waiting on Tori to confirm what the **ToF YT Reach/Traffic investment** will look like.

- **2025-07-10 10:58** *User_GR9M7E*: Hey @Jourdan and team, our Shopping campaign has had a bit of drop off in spends and revenue recently, so I did a little digging and noticed that *bundles* were the primary cause. I believe the bundle images which are synced to GMC showcases the evergreen offer, and because of this, GMC has disapproved those SKUs as promotional imagery is not allowed in Google Shopping placements. Would you guys be able to provide <mailto:rahul@sharmabrands.com|rahul@sharmabrands.com> and <mailto:berkeley@sharmabrands.com|berkeley@sharmabrands.com> admin access to your GMC, and also provide us alternate image links for each bundle that's live on-site, which doesn't showcase the offer?

- **2025-07-15 13:51** *User_GR9M7E*: Hey @Ingrid @Jourdan @Chris Jacob, more good news! I've managed to get most of our bundles approved on GMC, which were previously flagged as having promotional imagery and were disapproved. The fix of adding a supplemental feed with the new image links (without the promo stickers) worked :relaxed:  
  
The Sauna Blanket Starter Kit is still disapproved but I have requested a review from GMC. Will keep an eye here and let you guys know once it's approved too.  
  
I also noticed that the Summer Travel Glow Kit is missing on GMC. I can work on getting it added although I might need some clarity as to who manages the current product feeds on GMC. I've attached a screenshot of the feeds (data sources) connected to GMC. Once I know who currently manages them, I can work closely with them to get the new bundle added and make any further optis.

The other one you shared is all set now since I passed the supplemental feed to fix the issue. We can ignore the one from the Canada feed for now since we don’t have any campaigns delivering there.  
Would love to get a quick call on the books with you this week to walk through the current feed setup so I can get fully caught up.

- **2025-07-18 12:07** *User_GR9M7E* 💬 11 replies: Hey @Jourdan @Ingrid – sharing a quick update on the ***PMax scaling test***, since today marks the end of the 30-day test window (June 19 to July 17).  
  
*Overall, scaling results look promising.*  
**Here’s a breakdown based on *Northbeam 1DC data* (Jun 19–Jul 17 vs. previous period):**  
• *Non-Brand PEMF PMax* up 131% in revenue | 1.68 ROAS (+20%) | *NB 1DC*  
• *Non-Brand Sauna Blanket PMax* up 40% in revenue | 1.60 ROAS (-33%) | *NB 1DC*  
• *Non-Brand Red Light PMax* up 43% in revenue | 1.58 ROAS (+1%) | *NB 1DC*  
Note: The previous period included the *Body Sculptor launch and Father’s Day sale*, so we’re comparing against an inflated baseline.  
  
**From *Google in-platform data for Pmax* (Jun 19–Jul 10 vs. previous period):**  
• Impressions up 19%  
• Clicks up +35%  
• CTR up +14%  
• CPV down -14%  
• Revenue down -41% (likely due to the stronger comparison period)  
The drop in CPV supports what Google mentioned about PMax leaning more into *Top-of-Funnel placements like YouTube*, which helps build awareness efficiently.  
  
***Recommendation:***  
Let’s maintain current PMax budget levels, given the incremental revenue in 3 of the 5 scaled campaigns and clear improvements in traffic quality.  
  
***Budget note*** cc: @Jourdan @Ingrid:  
We’re currently pacing about **$30K over the $100K Google budget** for July. This was expected, as we committed to running the **30-day PMax scaling test** through its full cycle.  
We’ve noticed that the **influencer platform is under-pacing** against July budgets. Let us know if we can reallocate from there to help absorb the Google overage.  
If you’d like us to **scale further into top-performing PMax campaigns**, we’re happy to — but we’d need an **additional ~$2,800** for the rest of the month to do so.  
Let us know how you'd like us to move forward.  
Thanks! cc: @User*VC4WJH @User*2RULPN @User_D39C0Z
- **2025-07-18 13:29** *Jourdan*: Hey @User*GR9M7E thank you for the update and all the context that’s super helpful.  
  
We’re still down 9% YoY and since Google is the primary channel we don’t want to pull back if anything I want to keep pushing budgets on Google since we’re down 23% in spend Last 7.  
  
Do you have insights into why budget is pulling back?  
  
  
CC: @User*2RULPN I also see some under performing campaigns on Meta like PEMF and Sauna Blanket that we could reduce spend on, shift budget to other performing campaigns, or shift the budget to google.  
  
I’d love to know both of your thoughts so we can keep pushing revenue up.  
  
I know we’re up against a few challenges compared to last year but we’re not too far behind on rev.\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*

- **2025-07-24 07:06** *User_GR9M7E* 💬 7 replies: Hey @Chris Jacob it looks like the recent domain switch might've caused some PDP URLs to change and this has caused a bunch of  disapprovals on GMC. Since the current product feeds are set up through B&T's feedonomics enterprise account, can we have them take a look and pass the updated PDP URLs to GMC? Alternatively, we can set up a supplemental feed with the updated URLs from our end. Let us know how you want to move forward.  
cc: @Jourdan @Ingrid @User*D39C0Z @User*VC4WJH
- **2025-07-24 09:00** *User_GR9M7E*: Roger that! @Jourdan I think first order of business is switching the bidding strategy to **"Maximize Conversion Value"** and allowing the campaigns to spend their full budget (~$540/day) and collect 50+ conversions in a 30 day period. During this time, we will definitely see lower efficiency but higher spending and conversions. After the campaigns collect sufficient data in a 30 day period (50+), we can switch to the **"Target ROAS"** bidding strategy to drive efficiency while focusing on maximizing revenue. Let me know if I have the green light to go ahead with the change.

- **2025-07-24 11:26** *User_GR9M7E*: Hey @Chris Jacob and @Jourdan, sharing through our **search impression share and CPC insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms :relaxed:  
  
**Core Brand - Screenshot 1**  
• Defending brand terms very well with an impression share of over 90%, consistently, for the past 7 weeks  
• CPCs are at an all time low - great news!  
• [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) 's share dropped over the last week. Amazon's drop might be related to the end of the offer there.   
**Sauna Blanket (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 2**  
• We're still the market leader. The gap between our share and competitors' share has widened, indicating strong evergreen performance  
**Red Light Hat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 3**  
• [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) have, once again, managed to become market leaders  
• Our impression share has been a little low consistently as we're dealing with severe competition (possibly with high budgets, bids and lower TROAS).   
• Reduced the Target ROAS Red Light Hat ad group by 20% to try to gain better market share  
• CPCs are reducing which is a solid sign and showcases return to evergreen periods  
**PEMF Mat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 4**  
• Have lost some market share to competitors, possibly due to higher budgets, bids and lower TROAS  
• Added dynamic keyword insertion in all ads under the PEMF ad group for better quality scores (relevance), hoping to win back impression share  
• Reduced the target ROAS of the PEMF ad group by 20% to try to win back market share  
• CPCs are reducing which is a solid sign and showcases return to evergreen periods

- **2025-07-24 16:04** *Jourdan* 💬 3 replies: Hey @Elyse &amp; @User_VC4WJH, I hope you’re both doing well! I’ve been digging into the numbers and we’re only about 1.5 % behind last year’s total sales—so we’re close, but I’d love to give July (and the rest of Q3) an extra push.  
  
I’m especially interested in what more we can do on the retention side. In other brands’ Klaviyo accounts I’m seeing a higher cadence—sometimes daily sends—but obviously that only works when it’s done thoughtfully and doesn’t fatigue the list or hurt deliverability.  
  
Could we  
1. Work towards daily campaign sends?   
2. Brainstorm audience segments we could touch that we haven’t already?  
3. Discuss list-growth opportunities so we can support increased sends ongoing?  
I’m happy to setup a quick sync and pull any data/insights ahead of time. Let me know what would be most helpful! Excited to collaborate and keep the momentum goin

The wholesale is lumpy because we don't get clean sell through data for everyone so a lot of data is based on when we large/bulk ship a PO  
In that regard I would look more at rolling 12 month columns than each individual month  
  
This is broken by underlying product (so a bundle is counted as one unit each of the component parts)\n\n📎 **Sell Through_March 2025.xlsx** (xlsx, 176.0KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F08LELCJVTL/sell_through_march_2025.xlsx)

- **2025-04-10 11:58** *Chris Jacob*: <!channel> i took a prescheduled call with Northbeam reps  
• They are available to Sharma for whatever if rollover help is needed  
• They are still failing to correctly clear out $0 order (we use for marketing comps and warranty replacements)  
• This affects anything in NB that relies on order count like AOV
- **2025-04-10 12:02** *User_VC4WJH* 💬 3 replies: @Chris Jacob We would love to attend that call and help move things along! We can also shoot through an urgent message right now to reps on our side to see if we can get the $0 orders resolved more quickly.
- **2025-04-10 15:40** *Chris Jacob*: <!channel> related to call just now it would be helpful to see if any info (even if imperfect) we have to date - few months of Northbeam, Motion, whatever - can inform any sense of the relative costs of converting into a sale of different products  
  
I have little notion of this and I think it can help inform a lot because, as examples  
• Blanket and Go Mat are same priced products - but very different maturity, ability for customer to understand, etc - what's our relative cost to convert?  
• A Pro Mat drops 3.2x a mask to the bottom line - I doubt it costs 3x spend to convert but even if it does the contribution margin gap is enormous

• Strong week in performance with ROAS and CAC both improving heavily in the account which resulted in a 14% revenue increase.  
• The main contributor in terms of revenue gained in the account was the Red Light Products ASC and the following ad drove home nearly 50% of attributed revenue for the campaign.  
    ◦ ***Ad**: MULT | VID | 16-20s VID | Lifestyle | Light | Red Light Hat | 040125 | Hat on the Go | PDP*  
• In terms of ROAS, the volume DABA campaign lead the way with a 8.24x ROAS.  
• This is a trend we are seeing in the Meta accounts recently where catalog ads are performing at a very high efficiency level compared to normal ad sets. With this in mind, we are looking at scaling where possible to keep up with the momentum.  
• Net new actions taken this week was the launch of the TOF Sauna Blanket creative testing campaign. Along with the Oprah ads, we are launching the first set of SB ads into this campaign today.  
• Along with this, we are also going to be launching the Red Light TOF creative testing campaign today too, heading into the weekend.  
[Best Performing Creative](https://projects.motionapp.com/snapshot/67f944b0c76352823f443bd1)  
• The DPA’s continued to have strong performance and the top 8 ads that spent over $750 L7 had a good mix of statics and videos.

Summary of optis:  
• Updated campaign objectives to "Sales" across Brand and Non-Brand Search to better align with performance goals.  
• Switched bidding strategies of two Brand Search campaigns to automated bidding across to drive scale.  
• Paused the underperforming Brand Sale ad group (0 revenue L60D) under US*Brand*Core campaign  
• Scaled budgets across top-performing campaigns to capture incremental revenue:  
    ◦ +10% on PMax Brand All Products &amp; PMax Non-Brand Sauna Blanket  
    ◦ +20% on PMax Brand Consumables &amp; PMax Non-Brand PEMF  
    ◦ +20% on Non-Brand Products Search  
• Reduced budget on PMax Non-Brand Red Light by 20% due to underperformance  
• Scaled down the three main Brand Search campaigns by 20% to assess top-line revenue impact.  
• Optimized all non-brand campaigns to bid exclusively on new customers (vs. just bidding higher).  
• Excluded brand terms from non-brand search campaigns.  
• Further scaled down US*PMax*NonBrand*RedLight by 20% — previous Apr 4 scale-down drove ROAS improvement without impacting revenue.  
• Paused poor-performing keywords in US*NonBrand*Concern that spent significantly without generating meaningful revenue over the last 60 days.  
• Paused low-performing ad in NonBrand*Concern*RedLightMask ad group to prioritize top-performing creative.

Actions taken and points for next week  
• Turned off underperformers in original SPC. Leaving only the top performers there to get everything we can out of them  
• Duped the SPC and kept only the creatives that had not gotten any spend to test if any of those are winners  
• Checked for usage rights and turned off the expired one  
• Working with Chandler and Blake to kickoff shop on the right foot. Would love to get something on the calendar with them for intros and learning  
• Start building true campaign structure as we get creative in

- **2025-04-14 16:11** *Ingrid*: Also, I'm worried we are not spending enough to meet/exceed those LY numbers - my suggestion is spending more on Meta where we have an efficient ROAS to at least 10% more than we spent last year.

- **2025-04-16 10:50** *User_GR9M7E*: Hey @Ingrid, apologies for the delay in sending this through but here's the **non-brand search impression share by product** along w/ some insights to consider.  
  
**Screenshot 1 -  Sauna Blanket**  
• CPCs hovering around $3 - $4  
• Our impression share is the best in the space and is around 30% on average  
• With new ad copy coming in, designed to improve strength and keyword-relevance, we're hoping to see impression share grow further.   
**Screenshot 2 -  Red Light Hat**  
• CPCs hovering around $4.5 - $8. Slightly volatile. More competitors in the space  
• There was a hike in CPCs during the week of Mar 3 - Mar 24. The green competitor ([illumiflow.com](http://illumiflow.com)) seems to have had an impact there.   
• More importantly, the red competitor ([irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com)) has had higher impression share in the red light hat space consistently, so we'll be taking a few pointers from them for our new hat search ad copy.   
**Screenshot 3 -  PEMF**   
• CPCs hovering around a $3.70- $4.40. Seeing a rise from week of Mar 24 - Apr 7.  
• We're slowly starting to loose impression share while Amazon is slowly gaining.   
• For our new PEMF search ad copy, we'll be sure to take some pointers from amazon.   
Let me know if you have any thoughts / insights I might've missed. Thank you!

- **2025-04-18 12:36** *User_TS27JN*: Hey @Ingrid happy Friday! Two quick questions for you. Performance has been good on the platform and in order to test creatives fully and continue growth we'd like to increase our daily budget. We have kept where it was before taking over, but would love to have the go ahead for another $350 in daily spend (we are currently around $825 daily). That would add $4200 to the tiktok monthly budget for april. Second, I know we spoke about making sure the copy matches the creatives yesterday. While using this current campaign type tiktok assigns the copy and given its performance we would like to avoid shutting it down. With your permission we'd like to leave this one live and have our team whip up some more evergreen copy for the future!

- **2025-04-29 10:21** *User_TS27JN*: Hi @Ingrid and team here are Tiktok updates for the week. We did a look back of MoM as opposed to YoY due to the low spend in 2024.  
High level updates:  
• Chris is planning to upload category authorization documentation for shop. We will take over effectively completely from there in terms of set up and shop ad management. Affiliate split to come as we continue building the account and are in a stable place shop wise.   
Whats next:  
• Our plan is to test 2-3 creative ideas at a time at a high spend as opposed to spreading the account thin given high CAC high AOV.  This will help us be more intentional about learnings and hopefully speed up that process. While we do creative test the account will continue seeing performance fluctuation.   
    ◦ With that we are building a testing schedule for easy visibility/tracking (this will include various campaign types including manual, SPC, and search as well as the creative testing idea itself). We'll provide benchmarks for each test in this doc too.   
• We are slowly testing and phasing out the non sparked SPCs as creative fatigues, but definitely want to take advantage of some really great creative currently in the account while we can (heavy sauna blanket before it goes out of season completely).   
Thank you and have a great rest of your week! CC @User_VC4WJH\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-04-29 at 11.09.48 AM.png** (png, 93.8KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F08Q8UEG5GS/screenshot_2025-04-29_at_11.09.48___am.png)
- **2025-04-30 10:39** *User_TS27JN*: Good morning @Ingrid! We'd like to really lean in to the sale on tiktok without jeopardizing the learnings currently happening in the account. Would it be possible to have a dedicated $750 daily budget towards the sale during this period (and next sale period!) and return back to the normal budget after? For this week that would be an additional ~$3750 in spend. If we see performance tick up we can ping as well! Let me know what you think. Thank you!

- **2025-05-05 11:09** *User_GR9M7E*: Hi @Ingrid, we wanted to share this with you directly before looping in the broader email thread with the Google reps. In short, we don't recommend scaling too much further in this time, given where we are at with efficiency. Often, we find reps try to push the limits of spend, so wanted to share the numbers below:  
  
• Last year (Apr 19–24, 2024), during the first six days of the Mother’s Day Sale, we spent $31,565.29 and generated $215,841.11 in revenue for a **ROAS of 6.84 and CPA of $92.53.**  
• This year (Apr 29–May 4, 2025), we spent $58,063.39 (+84% YoY) and drove $306,123.38 in revenue (+42% YoY), with a ROAS of 5.27 (-23% YoY) and a CPA of $110.72 (+20% YoY). These figures include late attribution.  
With scaling thus far, we've achieved incremental revenue at reduced efficiency. However, if we push further we would be risking an even lower ROAS and higher CAC and in this case, we would recommend holding steady with spend today or finding a middle ground.  
  
We also don't recommend maintaining elevated budgets after the initial sales phase ends as we expect efficiency to drop dramatically, but will hike back up again over next weekend. Let us know if you are aligned here - or prefer to push forward for topline growth in this time.  
Thanks!

We increased spend during this period, however we saw a legitimate incremental rise in sessions during this time. This just continues to confirm the idea of tiktok's lift into other channels as opposed to purely in platform purchases.

**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPCs hovering in the normal range ~$3  
• Amazon's impression share rose quite significantly last week. This might be due to heavy investment on brand terms during the Mother's Day Sale but we're eager to hear your insights here  
• Dermstore's impression share stands at 15.21% (below than the max target of 20% we've given them) although it did increase slightly WoW  
**General non-brand insights**   
• CPC's have spiked quite a bit last week for non-brand / product terms, especially against the red light hat. We believe that this might be an impact due to heavy competition / investment during the Mother's Day Sale period.   
• We'll report back by next week on whether CPCs normalize but we think there might be a few weeks of high CPCs due to the sale season this month (Mother's Day and Memorial Day)  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• We managed to improve impression share last week along with [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com) despite rising CPCs  
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• Our impression share has consistently been low in this space. We're aiming to share new ad copy for review by early next week in order to combat this  
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• We managed to increase our impression share last week which were slowly losing in previous weeks.

- **2025-05-08 15:11** *User_GR9M7E* 💬 4 replies: Hi @Ingrid, we’ve connected with our Google reps, Tori and Casey, regarding a preliminary **Demand Gen (YouTube) investment plan.** While their initial recommendation was a $100K/month budget ($3,333/day) to drive statistically significant learnings, we flagged that as outside our scope and asked for a more realistic alternative.  
They’ve since shared the attached plan, which outlines a "crawl, walk, run" approach to budget scaling. While our original recommendation was $7,500/month ($250/day), the minimum viable spend in their framework—the “crawl” scenario—is set at **$15K/month ($500/day).** Given this is the **lowest tier that still ensures meaningful learnings,** we believe it makes sense to move forward at that level.  
In terms of **performance measurement,** Google suggested methods such as a **search lift study (only eligible at a $1000/day budget) and accounting for view-through conversions** among other things, which are outlined in the **“Holistic Measurement Framework”** section of their plan.  
One thing to call out: we may see a **dip in overall account efficiency** by launching this campaign at a $500/day budget or more. Since Demand Gen focuses on **upper-funnel objectives** like awareness and consideration, we **shouldn’t expect it to perform on the same metrics as Search, Shopping, or PMax.** For that reason, we recommend **reporting on Demand Gen performance separately**, as it will likely contribute to downstream conversions across other campaigns or organic channels.

**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPCs have increased. Corresponds to a rise in impression share by [dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com), [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) and [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com).  
• This could be a result of these **competitors investing heavily** across the board during their **Mother's Day promos**.  
• [dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com) **surpassed the maximum target impression share** we've provided them (20%) last week. Stood at 32%. We recommend **escalating this** to them right away.  
• Finally, [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) has been increasingly bidding on our branded terms and captured the **best impression share among all competitors** last week. We'll keep a close eye here.  
**General non-brand insights**  
• CPCs fell last week but still high.  
• As mentioned in last week's update, we're seeing **CPCs trending up starting from the week of 4/21** which corresponds to increased competition in the ad auction heading into MD.  
• We might notice **higher CPCs** towards the latter part of the month as well due to **increased competition during MDW**  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com)'s impression share rose significantly last week while [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) also managed to increase impression share slightly  
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• Impression share of market leaders like [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) are falling while new brands like [currentbody.ca](http://currentbody.ca), [schoolofdermatology.com](http://schoolofdermatology.com) and [omniluxled.com](http://omniluxled.com) have recently started gaining impression share.  
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• Over the last 2 weeks, we've managed to increase our impression share (which we were losing earlier to others). New copy should help us improve this further.

• **[dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com) still bidding high** on our **brand terms surpassing the max. impression share** we've provided them for the second week in a row. We should ideally escalate ASAP!   
• [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) still having a relatively high impression share  
**Sauna Blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• CPC's have dropped last week as expected, being the week after Mother's Day week. It fell below the general average of ~$3.6 - $4.  
• While we managed to improve our impression share over the last 2 weeks, so has [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com). So did [instyle.com](http://instyle.com) and [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) over last week.  
• We also launched new Sharma ad copy under this non-brand ad group on 5/15 and are hoping to see some good impression share results over the next few weeks.    
**Red Light Hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• CPC's have normalized last week as expected, being the week after Mother's Day week  
• Market leaders [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) managed to improve impression share quite a bit last week along with us.   
**PEMF Mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• CPCs have remained elevated last week, in contrast to other search ad groups, and are likely to stay high this week and the next due to MDW  
• We have lost impression share last week although we were gaining in the previous two weeks (probably due to high spending for MD sale). Competitors like [oxfordmedicals.com](http://oxfordmedicals.com), [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com), [magnawavepemf.com](http://magnawavepemf.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) have gained IS quite a bit last week. To address this, new ad copy will be prioritized for this ad group next week (after the MDW sale). Aiming to share for review by end of next week. cc: @User*7DB7H9 @User*PT7LCE

**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPC's interestingly fell well below average last week!   
• This might be due to several factors:  
    ◦ Competitors like [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) losing impression share  
    ◦ Our impression share improving to over 99%   
    ◦ Last week, despite scaling brand search (along with all other campaigns) for the MDW sale, our spending for core brand terms reduced while clicks increased. This means we drove very efficient brand clicks due to our promo last week.   
• [dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com) is still having an impression share that's higher than 20% for our brand terms (at 32.21%), although, it didn't have much of an impact on our costs last week due to points mentioned above. We'll evaluate their impression share and the impact on our CPCs next week and report back on where they stand and if they are still influencing our brand search costs.  
• Finally, we didn't notice other brands receiving an impression share against our brand terms last week despite running offers with certain retailers.  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• CPCs increased last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• Interestingly, competitor impression share dropped last week and our impression share grew, which was quite a positive trend to see!   
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• CPCs increased last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• Market leaders ([irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com)) as well as HD and [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com), were able to improve impression share last week.  
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• CPCs remained high last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• On a positive note, our impression share grew with scaling and we were able to beat out competitors that were catching up to us the week before last.   
• **New Sharma ad copy for PEMF** aimed at improving ad relevance / quality scores and impression share will be shared for review **this week.** [cc: @User*7DB7H9] This copy will help us maintain a good impression share vs. competitors going into an evergreen period while scaling down campaigns.

- **2025-06-04 14:25** *User_GR9M7E*: Hi @Chris Jacob @Ingrid, here's a quick recap from today’s ***Google tag call:***  
• **Google Ads tracking** is confirmed to be working correctly via a test purchase.  
• For **GA4 tracking**, the rep said the current setup is fine, but asked us to check with your dev team / the team that set it up:  
    ◦ If they’re happy with the existing setup and recommend we continue with it. In this case, no further action is needed.  
    ◦ If they prefer / recommend switching to the new Shopify Google &amp; YouTube app setup. In this case, we can proceed—but we’ll need to **remove the current setup** to avoid duplicate conversions *afterwards*.  
Let me know what your team recommends. Also, it's important to not remove any set ups as of now, until we hear back from the team on the above.

- **2025-06-04 15:52** *User_GR9M7E* 💬 4 replies: Hey @Ingrid, given the reduced paid media budget this month, we don’t currently have the capacity to test into Demand Gen/YouTube—though we’re definitely eager to explore it, as we believe it has strong potential!  
Right now, the entire Google budget is being used to support existing campaigns, so there’s no room to layer in YouTube within the current allocation.  
Google recommends a **$500/day** minimum for meaningful results (≈**$15K/month**), but if we want to stay budget-conscious, we could start with **$300/day** (≈**$9K/month**).  
Let us know if this incremental budget for YT is possible for June, or if you'd prefer we revisit it next month.  
Thanks! cc: @User*D39C0Z @User*VC4WJH
- **2025-06-05 09:58** *User_GR9M7E*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through the weekly **search impression share insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms :relaxed:  
  
**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• Our impression share dropped off a bit last week (Generally 95%+ but last week it came down to 85%+). This is a result of us scaling down significantly last week to maintain efficiency during the last few days of the sale.   
• No cause for concern here since over the L7D, impression share is once again up to a 97.23% as we returned to an evergreen state.   
• Also happy to report that over the last two weeks, CPCs have trended down vs. evergreen (generally around $3). This could be the impact of us pushing dermstore to reduce bids and budgets for our brand keywords. cc: @Chris Jacob   
**General non-brand insights**  
• CPCs are still high last week vs. evergreen. This was expected due to most MDW sales bleeding into last week (high ad auction competition during MD).   
• We're expecting CPCs to drop off from this week (6/2) as we return to a fully evergreen state.  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• Over the last 4 weeks, [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com) seems to have improved their impression share which could be an indicator that they are bidding more into / scaling into sauna blanket terms, especially during sale periods.   
• Nevertheless, we're still the market leader and we expect to stay at this level as we return to an evergreen state while also having launched new ad copy which seems to be performing better vs. older copy.   
• We'll also ensure to scale if required to maintain our position as the market leader.   
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) still remain market leaders while [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com) also managed to improve their impression share last week, most likely due to high spending during Memorial Day.  
• We're planning on working on new ad copy under this ad group, which should allow us to improve our impression share and catch up to the market leaders during an evergreen state.   
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• We remain as market leaders in the space and are aiming to get copy launched soon (once approved) in order to improve our impression share further over the next few weeks.

- **2025-06-13 07:46** *User_GR9M7E*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing this week’s Google Search impression share and CPC update for brand and non-brand (product) terms :blush:  
  
**Core Brand (screenshot 1)**  
• We bounced back from the slight dip in impression share seen during the tail end of the MDW sale, now sitting strong at **97.86%** once again last week (up from 86.19% previous week).  
• What’s even better -- **CPCs dropped further** to **$1.43**, the lowest in over 2 months. This downward CPC trend started in the week of 5/19 and may still be influenced by reduced competition from Dermstore on branded terms. cc: @Chris Jacob  
**Sauna Blanket Non-Brand (screenshot 2)**  
• Our **impression share improved slightly to 38.78%** last week (from 35.08% the previous week), while **CPCs dropped from $5.07 to $3.82**—a positive shift post-sale, as expected, as we head into evergreen.  
• [Hydragun.com](http://Hydragun.com) remains aggressive, still above 30% IS, but we’re continuing to lead. New Sharma copy may be helping us stay in the lead here.  
**Red Light Hat Non-Brand (screenshot 3)**  
• Impression share dipped to **15.53%** last week (vs. 19.04% the previous week), likely from the effects of returning to an evergreen state *with reduced budgets* in June.  
• **CPCs came down slightly** from $7.71 to **$6.90**, which is a step in the right direction post-sale but we expect it to reduce further / normalize over the next few weeks during evergreen.   
**PEMF Mat Non-Brand (screenshot 4)**  
• Holding relatively steady with a **22.10% impression share**, just a minor drop from last week.  
• **CPCs also dropped** to **$5.01**, down from $5.82 post sale, as expected. We expect this to reduce further / normalize over the next few weeks during evergreen.   
• Thanks for approving the new PEMF search copy. Once this is launched, we expect to improve IS and improve our lead against competitors.

- **2025-06-24 10:04** *User_TS27JN*: Hi team- we ran out of time today, so here are our tiktok updates for the last week!  
  
**Tiktok Performance L7 (6/16-6/22)**  
1DC Northbeam  
$6,760 (NC)  
ROAS: 0.18 (+251% WoW)  
Revenue: $1,220 (+250% WoW)  
CAC: $2,250 (-66.73% WoW)  
  
Updates and next steps  
• The low AOV product funnel is fully built out and has been spending since Friday  
    ◦ NB shows a .11 roas overall with a .21 roas in the retargeting ad group. This has started off slowly and we’re making adjustments this week. If we do not see significant improvement by the end of the week we’ll look to end this test   
• Our next test is to focus heavily on the high aov products as opposed to the low aov ones and segment these out closely  
• We are preparing to move body sculpt to a conversion focused campaign in July as well. The traffic campaign has been excellent so far with a .22 CPC and a CTR of 2.62.

- **2025-06-24 10:24** *User_GR9M7E*: Hey @Jourdan, these are the **"platform comparable"** metrics I was referring to, which are available for Demand Gen campaigns *only*. For these columns, conversions are attributed in a similar way to how paid social platforms like Meta attributes conversions, which gives a better picture on the true performance/impact of a Demand Gen campaigns.  
Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-24 at 8.52.48 PM.png** (png, 653.0KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F092T0CFCCD/screenshot_2025-06-24_at_8.52.48_pm.png)

- **2025-06-28 05:29** *User_GR9M7E* 💬 2 replies: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, apologies for the delay here. Sharing through our weekly **search impression share insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms.  
  
**Core Brand - Screenshot 1**  
• Impression share dropped to 91.91% in week 6/9. Correlates to scaling down post Father's Day sale on Jun 10.   
• Rose to **94.40% last week** most likely as a response to scaling back up based on Google rep recommendations   
• Staying strong above 90% for 7 of the past 8 weeks.  
• CPCs remain very efficient at **$1.68**, down significantly from early May highs. It has been under $2 since week 5/19 -- correlates to when dermstore confirmed they've been bidding less on our brand terms.   
• Key competitors (**Dermstore**, **Hydragun**) have pulled back / lost impression share over the last couple of weeks.  
• Amazon however increased their impression share over the last 2 weeks  
• Brand terms are well-defended with low CPCs, high impression share :white*check*mark:  
**Sauna Blanket (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 2**  
• Impression share rose to **33.41% last week**, recovering slightly from previous week’s dip -- most likely due to scaling down in week 6/9 and scaling back up in week 6/16.  
• CPCs dropped to **$4.66 last week**, down from $5.38 (Father's Day Sale week, 5/9) — a good sign of improving efficiency during an evergreen state although it hasn't reached true evergreen levels yet.  
• **Hydragun** remains our main competitor but is also trending down. **Amazon** managed to gain impression share over the last two weeks.  
• We have a decent lead, but still below May peak. This is most likely as we've scaled down dramatically in June.   
**Red Light Hat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 3**  
• **iRestore** and **Kiierr** continue to dominate the space.  
• Our share edged up to **11.41% last week**, but still far below the **31%** peak in week 5/9, likely due to scaling down significantly in June.  
• CPCs improved to **$6.08 last week**, down from over $10 in week 4/28. Slowly stabilizing post sales although it hasn't reached true evergreen levels yet.   
• **New Red Light Hat search copy** was launched this week and we expect to see an improvement in our share over the next few weeks.   
**PEMF Mat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 4**  
• Slight rise in share to **21.43% last week**, but still below earlier highs. Competitors, **Magnawavepemf** and **Healthnews** gaining ground. Likely due to scaling down significantly in June.  
• **New PEMF search copy** launched this week and we expect to see an improvement in our share over the next few weeks. We should also ideally think of scaling here to recapture impression share.   
• CPCs stable at **$5.05**, within recent averages. \n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.18.16 PM.png** (png, 418.2KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093F0GP329/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.18.16_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.18.51 PM.png** (png, 505.5KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093WFE289X/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.18.51_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.19.14 PM.png** (png, 550.7KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093F0H9W2Z/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.19.14_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.19.34 PM.png** (png, 524.0KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093BF2SGQN/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.19.34_pm.png)

**Spend: $6,200**  
**Revenue: $804**  
**ROAS: .13** (-35.58%)  
**CAC: $3,100 (+30.90%)**   
Updates and next steps  
• The body sculpt focused funnel has started off well both in platform and in NB.  
    ◦ In platform: 4.54 ROAS $73 CAC  
    ◦ NB clicks only: .68 ROAS   
    ◦ Awareness metrics: 62.3% LP view rate, .72 CPC. We will look to refresh this campaign to keep driving these metrics   
• In the pipeline is our full high aov product funnel  
    ◦ We'll launch this if body sculpt falls off/budget supports!  
Traffic campaigns in June (Roughly 12% of spend this week)  
• .35 CPC, 1.56% CTR and a Landing page view rate 66.14%  
[Creative Report](https://projects.motionapp.com/snapshot/1c57f4ef-091a-473c-9802-ac496beffacb)  
• 027 V4 is our top performer in platform and on NB. The sound and text overlay are both key factors here. The background sound is consistent in the top performing body sculpt creatives 
- **2025-07-09 09:09** *User_GR9M7E*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through our **search impression share and CPC insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms.  
  
**Core Brand - Screenshot 1**  
• Defending brand terms very well with an impression share consistently over 90%, over the last 8+ weeks.  
• [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) have increased impression share over the last 4 weeks, indicating higher bidding on our brand terms.   
**Sauna Blanket (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 2**  
• Defending market share well - still the market leader. [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) is our main competitor in the space.   
• CPCs seem to be normalizing over the last 3 weeks, showcasing a slow return to an evergreen state  
**Red Light Hat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 3**  
• Market leaders [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) have seen a significant drop in impression share over the last 2 weeks. Possibly due to scaling down drastically post promos. Showcases a need to scale significantly during sale periods to remain competitive with them.  
• Competitors like [schoolofdermatology.com](http://schoolofdermatology.com) and [omniluxled.com](http://omniluxled.com) have managed to improve their share in the space and a new competitor has entered the auction house ([hoogahealth.com](http://hoogahealth.com))   
• We want to scale this campaign by 20% this week to assess if we can capture some additional impression share, traffic and conversions.   
**PEMF Mat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 4**  
• We remain market leaders in the space despite scaling down drastically in June. This indicates strong performance during evergreen periods. We also recently launched new ad copy under the PEMF ad group aimed at improving quality scores and impression share which seems to be working well in defending our share.   
• [magnawavepemf.com](http://magnawavepemf.com) remains our biggest competitor in the space.   
• CPCs are dropping / stabilizing, indicating a slow return to an evergreen state.

- **2025-07-10 09:20** *User_GR9M7E* 💬 5 replies: Hey @Ingrid (cc: @Jourdan), we met with our Google rep Tori yesterday and here’s what we aligned on—sharing for visibility:  
• We’ll let the **Pmax scaling test** run for 30 days (from June 19 until July 18), then scale down any campaigns that aren’t driving incremental revenue post scale.  
 • On July 12 (after Prime Day), we’ll **increase the target ROAS** on one Pmax campaign by +15% and monitor for around 2 weeks before deciding whether to roll this out to other campaigns.  
 • **Demand Gen scaling to $500/day** will realistically need about 6 weeks for proper learning according to Tori. Let us know if you guys are down to up the budget to $500/day from the current $300/day.  
 • Waiting on Tori to confirm what the **ToF YT Reach/Traffic investment** will look like.

- **2025-07-10 10:58** *User_GR9M7E*: Hey @Jourdan and team, our Shopping campaign has had a bit of drop off in spends and revenue recently, so I did a little digging and noticed that *bundles* were the primary cause. I believe the bundle images which are synced to GMC showcases the evergreen offer, and because of this, GMC has disapproved those SKUs as promotional imagery is not allowed in Google Shopping placements. Would you guys be able to provide <mailto:rahul@sharmabrands.com|rahul@sharmabrands.com> and <mailto:berkeley@sharmabrands.com|berkeley@sharmabrands.com> admin access to your GMC, and also provide us alternate image links for each bundle that's live on-site, which doesn't showcase the offer?  
Thanks in advance!

I've managed to get most of our bundles approved on GMC, which were previously flagged as having promotional imagery and were disapproved. The fix of adding a supplemental feed with the new image links (without the promo stickers) worked :relaxed:  
  
The Sauna Blanket Starter Kit is still disapproved but I have requested a review from GMC. Will keep an eye here and let you guys know once it's approved too.  
  
I also noticed that the Summer Travel Glow Kit is missing on GMC. I can work on getting it added although I might need some clarity as to who manages the current product feeds on GMC. I've attached a screenshot of the feeds (data sources) connected to GMC. Once I know who currently manages them, I can work closely with them to get the new bundle added and make any further optis.

The other one you shared is all set now since I passed the supplemental feed to fix the issue. We can ignore the one from the Canada feed for now since we don’t have any campaigns delivering there.  
Would love to get a quick call on the books with you this week to walk through the current feed setup so I can get fully caught up.

- **2025-07-18 12:07** *User_GR9M7E* 💬 11 replies: Hey @Jourdan @Ingrid – sharing a quick update on the ***PMax scaling test***, since today marks the end of the 30-day test window (June 19 to July 17).  
  
*Overall, scaling results look promising.*  
**Here’s a breakdown based on *Northbeam 1DC data* (Jun 19–Jul 17 vs. previous period):**  
• *Non-Brand PEMF PMax* up 131% in revenue | 1.68 ROAS (+20%) | *NB 1DC*  
• *Non-Brand Sauna Blanket PMax* up 40% in revenue | 1.60 ROAS (-33%) | *NB 1DC*  
• *Non-Brand Red Light PMax* up 43% in revenue | 1.58 ROAS (+1%) | *NB 1DC*  
Note: The previous period included the *Body Sculptor launch and Father’s Day sale*, so we’re comparing against an inflated baseline.  
  
**From *Google in-platform data for Pmax* (Jun 19–Jul 10 vs. previous period):**  
• Impressions up 19%  
• Clicks up +35%  
• CTR up +14%  
• CPV down -14%  
• Revenue down -41% (likely due to the stronger comparison period)  
The drop in CPV supports what Google mentioned about PMax leaning more into *Top-of-Funnel placements like YouTube*, which helps build awareness efficiently.  
  
***Recommendation:***  
Let’s maintain current PMax budget levels, given the incremental revenue in 3 of the 5 scaled campaigns and clear improvements in traffic quality.  
  
***Budget note*** cc: @Jourdan @Ingrid:  
We’re currently pacing about **$30K over the $100K Google budget** for July. This was expected, as we committed to running the **30-day PMax scaling test** through its full cycle.  
We’ve noticed that the **influencer platform is under-pacing** against July budgets. Let us know if we can reallocate from there to help absorb the Google overage.  
If you’d like us to **scale further into top-performing PMax campaigns**, we’re happy to — but we’d need an **additional ~$2,800** for the rest of the month to do so.  
Let us know how you'd like us to move forward.  
Thanks! cc: @User*VC4WJH @User*2RULPN @User_D39C0Z
- **2025-07-18 13:29** *Jourdan*: Hey @User*GR9M7E thank you for the update and all the context that’s super helpful.  
  
We’re still down 9% YoY and since Google is the primary channel we don’t want to pull back if anything I want to keep pushing budgets on Google since we’re down 23% in spend Last 7.  
  
Do you have insights into why budget is pulling back?  
  
  
CC: @User*2RULPN I also see some under performing campaigns on Meta like PEMF and Sauna Blanket that we could reduce spend on, shift budget to other performing campaigns, or shift the budget to google.  
  
I’d love to know both of your thoughts so we can keep pushing revenue up.  
  
I know we’re up against a few challenges compared to last year but we’re not too far behind on rev.\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*

- **2025-07-24 07:06** *User_GR9M7E* 💬 7 replies: Hey @Chris Jacob it looks like the recent domain switch might've caused some PDP URLs to change and this has caused a bunch of  disapprovals on GMC. Since the current product feeds are set up through B&T's feedonomics enterprise account, can we have them take a look and pass the updated PDP URLs to GMC? Alternatively, we can set up a supplemental feed with the updated URLs from our end. Let us know how you want to move forward.  
cc: @Jourdan @Ingrid @User*D39C0Z @User*VC4WJH
- **2025-07-24 09:00** *User_GR9M7E*: Roger that! @Jourdan I think first order of business is switching the bidding strategy to **"Maximize Conversion Value"** and allowing the campaigns to spend their full budget (~$540/day) and collect 50+ conversions in a 30 day period. During this time, we will definitely see lower efficiency but higher spending and conversions. After the campaigns collect sufficient data in a 30 day period (50+), we can switch to the **"Target ROAS"** bidding strategy to drive efficiency while focusing on maximizing revenue. Let me know if I have the green light to go ahead with the change.

- **2025-07-24 11:26** *User_GR9M7E*: Hey @Chris Jacob and @Jourdan, sharing through our **search impression share and CPC insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms :relaxed:  
  
**Core Brand - Screenshot 1**  
• Defending brand terms very well with an impression share of over 90%, consistently, for the past 7 weeks  
• CPCs are at an all time low - great news!  
• [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) 's share dropped over the last week. Amazon's drop might be related to the end of the offer there.   
**Sauna Blanket (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 2**  
• We're still the market leader. The gap between our share and competitors' share has widened, indicating strong evergreen performance  
**Red Light Hat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 3**  
• [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) have, once again, managed to become market leaders  
• Our impression share has been a little low consistently as we're dealing with severe competition (possibly with high budgets, bids and lower TROAS).   
• Reduced the Target ROAS Red Light Hat ad group by 20% to try to gain better market share  
• CPCs are reducing which is a solid sign and showcases return to evergreen periods  
**PEMF Mat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 4**  
• Have lost some market share to competitors, possibly due to higher budgets, bids and lower TROAS  
• Added dynamic keyword insertion in all ads under the PEMF ad group for better quality scores (relevance), hoping to win back impression share  
• Reduced the target ROAS of the PEMF ad group by 20% to try to win back market share  
• CPCs are reducing which is a solid sign and showcases return to evergreen periods

- **2025-07-24 16:04** *Jourdan* 💬 3 replies: Hey @Elyse &amp; @User_VC4WJH, I hope you’re both doing well! I’ve been digging into the numbers and we’re only about 1.5 % behind last year’s total sales—so we’re close, but I’d love to give July (and the rest of Q3) an extra push.  
  
I’m especially interested in what more we can do on the retention side. In other brands’ Klaviyo accounts I’m seeing a higher cadence—sometimes daily sends—but obviously that only works when it’s done thoughtfully and doesn’t fatigue the list or hurt deliverability.  
  
Could we  
1. Work towards daily campaign sends?   
2. Brainstorm audience segments we could touch that we haven’t already?  
3. Discuss list-growth opportunities so we can support increased sends ongoing?  
I’m happy to setup a quick sync and pull any data/insights ahead of time. Let me know what would be most helpful! Excited to collaborate and keep the momentum goin

The wholesale is lumpy because we don't get clean sell through data for everyone so a lot of data is based on when we large/bulk ship a PO  
In that regard I would look more at rolling 12 month columns than each individual month  
  
This is broken by underlying product (so a bundle is counted as one unit each of the component parts)\n\n📎 **Sell Through_March 2025.xlsx** (xlsx, 176.0KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F08LELCJVTL/sell_through_march_2025.xlsx)

- **2025-04-10 11:58** *Chris Jacob*: <!channel> i took a prescheduled call with Northbeam reps  
• They are available to Sharma for whatever if rollover help is needed  
• They are still failing to correctly clear out $0 order (we use for marketing comps and warranty replacements)  
• This affects anything in NB that relies on order count like AOV
- **2025-04-10 12:02** *Berkeley Clark* 💬 3 replies: @Chris Jacob We would love to attend that call and help move things along! We can also shoot through an urgent message right now to reps on our side to see if we can get the $0 orders resolved more quickly.
- **2025-04-10 15:40** *Chris Jacob*: <!channel> related to call just now it would be helpful to see if any info (even if imperfect) we have to date - few months of Northbeam, Motion, whatever - can inform any sense of the relative costs of converting into a sale of different products  
  
I have little notion of this and I think it can help inform a lot because, as examples  
• Blanket and Go Mat are same priced products - but very different maturity, ability for customer to understand, etc - what's our relative cost to convert?  
• A Pro Mat drops 3.2x a mask to the bottom line - I doubt it costs 3x spend to convert but even if it does the contribution margin gap is enormous

• In terms of ROAS, the volume DABA campaign lead the way with a 8.24x ROAS.  
• This is a trend we are seeing in the Meta accounts recently where catalog ads are performing at a very high efficiency level compared to normal ad sets. With this in mind, we are looking at scaling where possible to keep up with the momentum.  
• Net new actions taken this week was the launch of the TOF Sauna Blanket creative testing campaign. Along with the Oprah ads, we are launching the first set of SB ads into this campaign today.  
• Along with this, we are also going to be launching the Red Light TOF creative testing campaign today too, heading into the weekend.  
[Best Performing Creative](https://projects.motionapp.com/snapshot/67f944b0c76352823f443bd1)

• Switched bidding strategies of two Brand Search campaigns to automated bidding across to drive scale.  
• Paused the underperforming Brand Sale ad group (0 revenue L60D) under US*Brand*Core campaign  
• Scaled budgets across top-performing campaigns to capture incremental revenue:  
    ◦ +10% on PMax Brand All Products &amp; PMax Non-Brand Sauna Blanket  
    ◦ +20% on PMax Brand Consumables &amp; PMax Non-Brand PEMF  
    ◦ +20% on Non-Brand Products Search  
• Reduced budget on PMax Non-Brand Red Light by 20% due to underperformance  
• Scaled down the three main Brand Search campaigns by 20% to assess top-line revenue impact.  
• Optimized all non-brand campaigns to bid exclusively on new customers (vs. just bidding higher).  
• Excluded brand terms from non-brand search campaigns.  
• Further scaled down US*PMax*NonBrand*RedLight by 20% — previous Apr 4 scale-down drove ROAS improvement without impacting revenue.  
• Paused poor-performing keywords in US*NonBrand*Concern that spent significantly without generating meaningful revenue over the last 60 days.  
• Paused low-performing ad in NonBrand*Concern*RedLightMask ad group to prioritize top-performing creative.

Actions taken and points for next week  
• Turned off underperformers in original SPC. Leaving only the top performers there to get everything we can out of them  
• Duped the SPC and kept only the creatives that had not gotten any spend to test if any of those are winners  
• Checked for usage rights and turned off the expired one  
• Working with Chandler and Blake to kickoff shop on the right foot. Would love to get something on the calendar with them for intros and learning  
• Start building true campaign structure as we get creative in

- **2025-04-14 16:11** *Ingrid*: Also, I'm worried we are not spending enough to meet/exceed those LY numbers - my suggestion is spending more on Meta where we have an efficient ROAS to at least 10% more than we spent last year.

- **2025-04-16 10:50** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Ingrid, apologies for the delay in sending this through but here's the **non-brand search impression share by product** along w/ some insights to consider.  
  
**Screenshot 1 -  Sauna Blanket**  
• CPCs hovering around $3 - $4  
• Our impression share is the best in the space and is around 30% on average  
• With new ad copy coming in, designed to improve strength and keyword-relevance, we're hoping to see impression share grow further.   
**Screenshot 2 -  Red Light Hat**  
• CPCs hovering around $4.5 - $8. Slightly volatile. More competitors in the space  
• There was a hike in CPCs during the week of Mar 3 - Mar 24. The green competitor ([illumiflow.com](http://illumiflow.com)) seems to have had an impact there.   
• More importantly, the red competitor ([irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com)) has had higher impression share in the red light hat space consistently, so we'll be taking a few pointers from them for our new hat search ad copy.   
**Screenshot 3 -  PEMF**   
• CPCs hovering around a $3.70- $4.40. Seeing a rise from week of Mar 24 - Apr 7.  
• We're slowly starting to loose impression share while Amazon is slowly gaining.   
• For our new PEMF search ad copy, we'll be sure to take some pointers from amazon.   
Let me know if you have any thoughts / insights I might've missed. Thank you!

- **2025-04-18 12:36** *User_TS27JN*: Hey @Ingrid happy Friday! Two quick questions for you. Performance has been good on the platform and in order to test creatives fully and continue growth we'd like to increase our daily budget. We have kept where it was before taking over, but would love to have the go ahead for another $350 in daily spend (we are currently around $825 daily). That would add $4200 to the tiktok monthly budget for april. Second, I know we spoke about making sure the copy matches the creatives yesterday. While using this current campaign type tiktok assigns the copy and given its performance we would like to avoid shutting it down. With your permission we'd like to leave this one live and have our team whip up some more evergreen copy for the future!

- **2025-04-29 10:21** *User_TS27JN*: Hi @Ingrid and team here are Tiktok updates for the week. We did a look back of MoM as opposed to YoY due to the low spend in 2024.  
High level updates:  
• Chris is planning to upload category authorization documentation for shop. We will take over effectively completely from there in terms of set up and shop ad management. Affiliate split to come as we continue building the account and are in a stable place shop wise.   
Whats next:  
• Our plan is to test 2-3 creative ideas at a time at a high spend as opposed to spreading the account thin given high CAC high AOV.  This will help us be more intentional about learnings and hopefully speed up that process. While we do creative test the account will continue seeing performance fluctuation.   
    ◦ With that we are building a testing schedule for easy visibility/tracking (this will include various campaign types including manual, SPC, and search as well as the creative testing idea itself). We'll provide benchmarks for each test in this doc too.   
• We are slowly testing and phasing out the non sparked SPCs as creative fatigues, but definitely want to take advantage of some really great creative currently in the account while we can (heavy sauna blanket before it goes out of season completely).

- **2025-05-05 11:09** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hi @Ingrid, we wanted to share this with you directly before looping in the broader email thread with the Google reps. In short, we don't recommend scaling too much further in this time, given where we are at with efficiency. Often, we find reps try to push the limits of spend, so wanted to share the numbers below:  
  
• Last year (Apr 19–24, 2024), during the first six days of the Mother’s Day Sale, we spent $31,565.29 and generated $215,841.11 in revenue for a **ROAS of 6.84 and CPA of $92.53.**  
• This year (Apr 29–May 4, 2025), we spent $58,063.39 (+84% YoY) and drove $306,123.38 in revenue (+42% YoY), with a ROAS of 5.27 (-23% YoY) and a CPA of $110.72 (+20% YoY). These figures include late attribution.  
With scaling thus far, we've achieved incremental revenue at reduced efficiency. However, if we push further we would be risking an even lower ROAS and higher CAC and in this case, we would recommend holding steady with spend today or finding a middle ground.  
  
We also don't recommend maintaining elevated budgets after the initial sales phase ends as we expect efficiency to drop dramatically, but will hike back up again over next weekend. Let us know if you are aligned here - or prefer to push forward for topline growth in this time.  
Thanks!

- **2025-05-06 14:25** *User_TS27JN*: Hey @Ingrid had an interesting callout regarding tiktok during the sale period. We increased spend during this period, however we saw a legitimate incremental rise in sessions during this time. This just continues to confirm the idea of tiktok's lift into other channels as opposed to purely in platform purchases.

**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPCs hovering in the normal range ~$3  
• Amazon's impression share rose quite significantly last week. This might be due to heavy investment on brand terms during the Mother's Day Sale but we're eager to hear your insights here  
• Dermstore's impression share stands at 15.21% (below than the max target of 20% we've given them) although it did increase slightly WoW  
**General non-brand insights**   
• CPC's have spiked quite a bit last week for non-brand / product terms, especially against the red light hat. We believe that this might be an impact due to heavy competition / investment during the Mother's Day Sale period.   
• We'll report back by next week on whether CPCs normalize but we think there might be a few weeks of high CPCs due to the sale season this month (Mother's Day and Memorial Day)  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• We managed to improve impression share last week along with [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com) despite rising CPCs  
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• Our impression share has consistently been low in this space. We're aiming to share new ad copy for review by early next week in order to combat this  
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• We managed to increase our impression share last week which were slowly losing in previous weeks.

- **2025-05-08 15:11** *Rahul Vithanage* 💬 4 replies: Hi @Ingrid, we’ve connected with our Google reps, Tori and Casey, regarding a preliminary **Demand Gen (YouTube) investment plan.** While their initial recommendation was a $100K/month budget ($3,333/day) to drive statistically significant learnings, we flagged that as outside our scope and asked for a more realistic alternative.  
They’ve since shared the attached plan, which outlines a "crawl, walk, run" approach to budget scaling. While our original recommendation was $7,500/month ($250/day), the minimum viable spend in their framework—the “crawl” scenario—is set at **$15K/month ($500/day).** Given this is the **lowest tier that still ensures meaningful learnings,** we believe it makes sense to move forward at that level.  
In terms of **performance measurement,** Google suggested methods such as a **search lift study (only eligible at a $1000/day budget) and accounting for view-through conversions** among other things, which are outlined in the **“Holistic Measurement Framework”** section of their plan.  
One thing to call out: we may see a **dip in overall account efficiency** by launching this campaign at a $500/day budget or more. Since Demand Gen focuses on **upper-funnel objectives** like awareness and consideration, we **shouldn’t expect it to perform on the same metrics as Search, Shopping, or PMax.** For that reason, we recommend **reporting on Demand Gen performance separately**, as it will likely contribute to downstream conversions across other campaigns or organic channels.

- **2025-05-14 11:36** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through the weekly **search impression share insights** for **brand** and **non-brand (product) terms** :relaxed:  
  
**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPCs have increased. Corresponds to a rise in impression share by [dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com), [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) and [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com).  
• This could be a result of these **competitors investing heavily** across the board during their **Mother's Day promos**.  
• [dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com) **surpassed the maximum target impression share** we've provided them (20%) last week. Stood at 32%. We recommend **escalating this** to them right away.  
• Finally, [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) has been increasingly bidding on our branded terms and captured the **best impression share among all competitors** last week. We'll keep a close eye here.  
**General non-brand insights**  
• CPCs fell last week but still high.  
• As mentioned in last week's update, we're seeing **CPCs trending up starting from the week of 4/21** which corresponds to increased competition in the ad auction heading into MD.  
• We might notice **higher CPCs** towards the latter part of the month as well due to **increased competition during MDW**  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com)'s impression share rose significantly last week while [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) also managed to increase impression share slightly  
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• Impression share of market leaders like [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) are falling while new brands like [currentbody.ca](http://currentbody.ca), [schoolofdermatology.com](http://schoolofdermatology.com) and [omniluxled.com](http://omniluxled.com) have recently started gaining impression share.  
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• Over the last 2 weeks, we've managed to increase our impression share (which we were losing earlier to others). New copy should help us improve this further.

**Core Brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPC's have normalized last week as expected, being the week after Mother's Day week  
• **[dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com) still bidding high** on our **brand terms surpassing the max. impression share** we've provided them for the second week in a row. We should ideally escalate ASAP!   
• [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) still having a relatively high impression share  
**Sauna Blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• CPC's have dropped last week as expected, being the week after Mother's Day week. It fell below the general average of ~$3.6 - $4.  
• While we managed to improve our impression share over the last 2 weeks, so has [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com). So did [instyle.com](http://instyle.com) and [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) over last week.  
• We also launched new Sharma ad copy under this non-brand ad group on 5/15 and are hoping to see some good impression share results over the next few weeks.    
**Red Light Hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• CPC's have normalized last week as expected, being the week after Mother's Day week  
• Market leaders [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) managed to improve impression share quite a bit last week along with us.   
**PEMF Mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• CPCs have remained elevated last week, in contrast to other search ad groups, and are likely to stay high this week and the next due to MDW  
• We have lost impression share last week although we were gaining in the previous two weeks (probably due to high spending for MD sale). Competitors like [oxfordmedicals.com](http://oxfordmedicals.com), [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com), [magnawavepemf.com](http://magnawavepemf.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) have gained IS quite a bit last week. To address this, new ad copy will be prioritized for this ad group next week (after the MDW sale). Aiming to share for review by end of next week. cc: @User*7DB7H9 @User*PT7LCE

**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPC's interestingly fell well below average last week!   
• This might be due to several factors:  
    ◦ Competitors like [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) losing impression share  
    ◦ Our impression share improving to over 99%   
    ◦ Last week, despite scaling brand search (along with all other campaigns) for the MDW sale, our spending for core brand terms reduced while clicks increased. This means we drove very efficient brand clicks due to our promo last week.   
• [dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com) is still having an impression share that's higher than 20% for our brand terms (at 32.21%), although, it didn't have much of an impact on our costs last week due to points mentioned above. We'll evaluate their impression share and the impact on our CPCs next week and report back on where they stand and if they are still influencing our brand search costs.  
• Finally, we didn't notice other brands receiving an impression share against our brand terms last week despite running offers with certain retailers.  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• CPCs increased last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• Interestingly, competitor impression share dropped last week and our impression share grew, which was quite a positive trend to see!   
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• CPCs increased last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• Market leaders ([irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com)) as well as HD and [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com), were able to improve impression share last week.  
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• CPCs remained high last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• On a positive note, our impression share grew with scaling and we were able to beat out competitors that were catching up to us the week before last.   
• **New Sharma ad copy for PEMF** aimed at improving ad relevance / quality scores and impression share will be shared for review **this week.** [cc: @User_7DB7H9] This copy will help us maintain a good impression share vs. competitors going into an evergreen period while scaling down campaigns.

- **2025-06-04 14:25** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hi @Chris Jacob @Ingrid, here's a quick recap from today’s ***Google tag call:***  
• **Google Ads tracking** is confirmed to be working correctly via a test purchase.  
• For **GA4 tracking**, the rep said the current setup is fine, but asked us to check with your dev team / the team that set it up:  
    ◦ If they’re happy with the existing setup and recommend we continue with it. In this case, no further action is needed.  
    ◦ If they prefer / recommend switching to the new Shopify Google &amp; YouTube app setup. In this case, we can proceed—but we’ll need to **remove the current setup** to avoid duplicate conversions *afterwards*.  
Let me know what your team recommends. Also, it's important to not remove any set ups as of now, until we hear back from the team on the above.

- **2025-06-04 15:52** *Rahul Vithanage* 💬 4 replies: Hey @Ingrid, given the reduced paid media budget this month, we don’t currently have the capacity to test into Demand Gen/YouTube—though we’re definitely eager to explore it, as we believe it has strong potential!  
Right now, the entire Google budget is being used to support existing campaigns, so there’s no room to layer in YouTube within the current allocation.  
Google recommends a **$500/day** minimum for meaningful results (≈**$15K/month**), but if we want to stay budget-conscious, we could start with **$300/day** (≈**$9K/month**).  
Let us know if this incremental budget for YT is possible for June, or if you'd prefer we revisit it next month.  
Thanks! cc: @Ari Murray @Berkeley Clark
- **2025-06-05 09:58** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through the weekly **search impression share insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms :relaxed:  
  
**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• Our impression share dropped off a bit last week (Generally 95%+ but last week it came down to 85%+). This is a result of us scaling down significantly last week to maintain efficiency during the last few days of the sale.   
• No cause for concern here since over the L7D, impression share is once again up to a 97.23% as we returned to an evergreen state.   
• Also happy to report that over the last two weeks, CPCs have trended down vs. evergreen (generally around $3). This could be the impact of us pushing dermstore to reduce bids and budgets for our brand keywords. cc: @Chris Jacob   
**General non-brand insights**  
• CPCs are still high last week vs. evergreen. This was expected due to most MDW sales bleeding into last week (high ad auction competition during MD).   
• We're expecting CPCs to drop off from this week (6/2) as we return to a fully evergreen state.  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• Over the last 4 weeks, [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com) seems to have improved their impression share which could be an indicator that they are bidding more into / scaling into sauna blanket terms, especially during sale periods.   
• Nevertheless, we're still the market leader and we expect to stay at this level as we return to an evergreen state while also having launched new ad copy which seems to be performing better vs. older copy.   
• We'll also ensure to scale if required to maintain our position as the market leader.   
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) still remain market leaders while [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com) also managed to improve their impression share last week, most likely due to high spending during Memorial Day.  
• We're planning on working on new ad copy under this ad group, which should allow us to improve our impression share and catch up to the market leaders during an evergreen state.   
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• We remain as market leaders in the space and are aiming to get copy launched soon (once approved) in order to improve our impression share further over the next few weeks.

- **2025-06-13 07:46** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing this week’s Google Search impression share and CPC update for brand and non-brand (product) terms :blush:  
  
**Core Brand (screenshot 1)**  
• We bounced back from the slight dip in impression share seen during the tail end of the MDW sale, now sitting strong at **97.86%** once again last week (up from 86.19% previous week).  
• What’s even better -- **CPCs dropped further** to **$1.43**, the lowest in over 2 months. This downward CPC trend started in the week of 5/19 and may still be influenced by reduced competition from Dermstore on branded terms. cc: @Chris Jacob  
**Sauna Blanket Non-Brand (screenshot 2)**  
• Our **impression share improved slightly to 38.78%** last week (from 35.08% the previous week), while **CPCs dropped from $5.07 to $3.82**—a positive shift post-sale, as expected, as we head into evergreen.  
• [Hydragun.com](http://Hydragun.com) remains aggressive, still above 30% IS, but we’re continuing to lead. New Sharma copy may be helping us stay in the lead here.  
**Red Light Hat Non-Brand (screenshot 3)**  
• Impression share dipped to **15.53%** last week (vs. 19.04% the previous week), likely from the effects of returning to an evergreen state *with reduced budgets* in June.  
• **CPCs came down slightly** from $7.71 to **$6.90**, which is a step in the right direction post-sale but we expect it to reduce further / normalize over the next few weeks during evergreen.   
**PEMF Mat Non-Brand (screenshot 4)**  
• Holding relatively steady with a **22.10% impression share**, just a minor drop from last week.  
• **CPCs also dropped** to **$5.01**, down from $5.82 post sale, as expected. We expect this to reduce further / normalize over the next few weeks during evergreen.   
• Thanks for approving the new PEMF search copy. Once this is launched, we expect to improve IS and improve our lead against competitors.

**Tiktok Performance L7 (6/16-6/22)**  
1DC Northbeam  
$6,760 (NC)  
ROAS: 0.18 (+251% WoW)  
Revenue: $1,220 (+250% WoW)  
CAC: $2,250 (-66.73% WoW)  
  
Updates and next steps  
• The low AOV product funnel is fully built out and has been spending since Friday  
    ◦ NB shows a .11 roas overall with a .21 roas in the retargeting ad group. This has started off slowly and we’re making adjustments this week. If we do not see significant improvement by the end of the week we’ll look to end this test   
• Our next test is to focus heavily on the high aov products as opposed to the low aov ones and segment these out closely  
• We are preparing to move body sculpt to a conversion focused campaign in July as well. The traffic campaign has been excellent so far with a .22 CPC and a CTR of 2.62.

- **2025-06-24 10:24** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Jourdan, these are the **"platform comparable"** metrics I was referring to, which are available for Demand Gen campaigns *only*. For these columns, conversions are attributed in a similar way to how paid social platforms like Meta attributes conversions, which gives a better picture on the true performance/impact of a Demand Gen campaigns.

- **2025-06-28 05:29** *Rahul Vithanage* 💬 2 replies: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, apologies for the delay here. Sharing through our weekly **search impression share insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms.  
  
**Core Brand - Screenshot 1**  
• Impression share dropped to 91.91% in week 6/9. Correlates to scaling down post Father's Day sale on Jun 10.   
• Rose to **94.40% last week** most likely as a response to scaling back up based on Google rep recommendations   
• Staying strong above 90% for 7 of the past 8 weeks.  
• CPCs remain very efficient at **$1.68**, down significantly from early May highs. It has been under $2 since week 5/19 -- correlates to when dermstore confirmed they've been bidding less on our brand terms.   
• Key competitors (**Dermstore**, **Hydragun**) have pulled back / lost impression share over the last couple of weeks.  
• Amazon however increased their impression share over the last 2 weeks  
• Brand terms are well-defended with low CPCs, high impression share :white*check*mark:  
**Sauna Blanket (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 2**  
• Impression share rose to **33.41% last week**, recovering slightly from previous week’s dip -- most likely due to scaling down in week 6/9 and scaling back up in week 6/16.  
• CPCs dropped to **$4.66 last week**, down from $5.38 (Father's Day Sale week, 5/9) — a good sign of improving efficiency during an evergreen state although it hasn't reached true evergreen levels yet.  
• **Hydragun** remains our main competitor but is also trending down. **Amazon** managed to gain impression share over the last two weeks.  
• We have a decent lead, but still below May peak. This is most likely as we've scaled down dramatically in June.   
**Red Light Hat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 3**  
• **iRestore** and **Kiierr** continue to dominate the space.  
• Our share edged up to **11.41% last week**, but still far below the **31%** peak in week 5/9, likely due to scaling down significantly in June.  
• CPCs improved to **$6.08 last week**, down from over $10 in week 4/28. Slowly stabilizing post sales although it hasn't reached true evergreen levels yet.   
• **New Red Light Hat search copy** was launched this week and we expect to see an improvement in our share over the next few weeks.   
**PEMF Mat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 4**  
• Slight rise in share to **21.43% last week**, but still below earlier highs. Competitors, **Magnawavepemf** and **Healthnews** gaining ground. Likely due to scaling down significantly in June.  
• **New PEMF search copy** launched this week and we expect to see an improvement in our share over the next few weeks. We should also ideally think of scaling here to recapture impression share.   
• CPCs stable at **$5.05**, within recent averages. \n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.18.16 PM.png** (png, 418.2KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093F0GP329/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.18.16_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.18.51 PM.png** (png, 505.5KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093WFE289X/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.18.51_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.19.14 PM.png** (png, 550.7KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093F0H9W2Z/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.19.14_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.19.34 PM.png** (png, 524.0KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093BF2SGQN/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.19.34_pm.png)

**Spend: $6,200**  
**Revenue: $804**  
**ROAS: .13** (-35.58%)  
**CAC: $3,100 (+30.90%)**   
Updates and next steps  
• The body sculpt focused funnel has started off well both in platform and in NB.  
    ◦ In platform: 4.54 ROAS $73 CAC  
    ◦ NB clicks only: .68 ROAS   
    ◦ Awareness metrics: 62.3% LP view rate, .72 CPC. We will look to refresh this campaign to keep driving these metrics   
• In the pipeline is our full high aov product funnel  
    ◦ We'll launch this if body sculpt falls off/budget supports!  
Traffic campaigns in June (Roughly 12% of spend this week)  
• .35 CPC, 1.56% CTR and a Landing page view rate 66.14%  
[Creative Report](https://projects.motionapp.com/snapshot/1c57f4ef-091a-473c-9802-ac496beffacb)  
• 027 V4 is our top performer in platform and on NB. The sound and text overlay are both key factors here. The background sound is consistent in the top performing body sculpt creatives 
- **2025-07-09 09:09** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through our **search impression share and CPC insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms.  
  
**Core Brand - Screenshot 1**  
• Defending brand terms very well with an impression share consistently over 90%, over the last 8+ weeks.  
• [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) have increased impression share over the last 4 weeks, indicating higher bidding on our brand terms.   
**Sauna Blanket (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 2**  
• Defending market share well - still the market leader. [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) is our main competitor in the space.   
• CPCs seem to be normalizing over the last 3 weeks, showcasing a slow return to an evergreen state  
**Red Light Hat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 3**  
• Market leaders [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) have seen a significant drop in impression share over the last 2 weeks. Possibly due to scaling down drastically post promos. Showcases a need to scale significantly during sale periods to remain competitive with them.  
• Competitors like [schoolofdermatology.com](http://schoolofdermatology.com) and [omniluxled.com](http://omniluxled.com) have managed to improve their share in the space and a new competitor has entered the auction house ([hoogahealth.com](http://hoogahealth.com))   
• We want to scale this campaign by 20% this week to assess if we can capture some additional impression share, traffic and conversions.   
**PEMF Mat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 4**  
• We remain market leaders in the space despite scaling down drastically in June. This indicates strong performance during evergreen periods. We also recently launched new ad copy under the PEMF ad group aimed at improving quality scores and impression share which seems to be working well in defending our share.   
• [magnawavepemf.com](http://magnawavepemf.com) remains our biggest competitor in the space.   
• CPCs are dropping / stabilizing, indicating a slow return to an evergreen state.

- **2025-07-10 09:20** *Rahul Vithanage* 💬 5 replies: Hey @Ingrid (cc: @Jourdan), we met with our Google rep Tori yesterday and here’s what we aligned on—sharing for visibility:  
• We’ll let the **Pmax scaling test** run for 30 days (from June 19 until July 18), then scale down any campaigns that aren’t driving incremental revenue post scale.  
 • On July 12 (after Prime Day), we’ll **increase the target ROAS** on one Pmax campaign by +15% and monitor for around 2 weeks before deciding whether to roll this out to other campaigns.  
 • **Demand Gen scaling to $500/day** will realistically need about 6 weeks for proper learning according to Tori. Let us know if you guys are down to up the budget to $500/day from the current $300/day.  
 • Waiting on Tori to confirm what the **ToF YT Reach/Traffic investment** will look like.

- **2025-07-10 10:58** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Jourdan and team, our Shopping campaign has had a bit of drop off in spends and revenue recently, so I did a little digging and noticed that *bundles* were the primary cause. I believe the bundle images which are synced to GMC showcases the evergreen offer, and because of this, GMC has disapproved those SKUs as promotional imagery is not allowed in Google Shopping placements. Would you guys be able to provide <mailto:rahul@sharmabrands.com|rahul@sharmabrands.com> and <mailto:berkeley@sharmabrands.com|berkeley@sharmabrands.com> admin access to your GMC, and also provide us alternate image links for each bundle that's live on-site, which doesn't showcase the offer?  
Thanks in advance!

I've managed to get most of our bundles approved on GMC, which were previously flagged as having promotional imagery and were disapproved. The fix of adding a supplemental feed with the new image links (without the promo stickers) worked :relaxed:  
  
The Sauna Blanket Starter Kit is still disapproved but I have requested a review from GMC. Will keep an eye here and let you guys know once it's approved too.  
  
I also noticed that the Summer Travel Glow Kit is missing on GMC. I can work on getting it added although I might need some clarity as to who manages the current product feeds on GMC. I've attached a screenshot of the feeds (data sources) connected to GMC. Once I know who currently manages them, I can work closely with them to get the new bundle added and make any further optis.

The other one you shared is all set now since I passed the supplemental feed to fix the issue. We can ignore the one from the Canada feed for now since we don’t have any campaigns delivering there.  
Would love to get a quick call on the books with you this week to walk through the current feed setup so I can get fully caught up.

- **2025-07-18 12:07** *Rahul Vithanage* 💬 11 replies: Hey @Jourdan @Ingrid – sharing a quick update on the ***PMax scaling test***, since today marks the end of the 30-day test window (June 19 to July 17).  
  
*Overall, scaling results look promising.*  
**Here’s a breakdown based on *Northbeam 1DC data* (Jun 19–Jul 17 vs. previous period):**  
• *Non-Brand PEMF PMax* up 131% in revenue | 1.68 ROAS (+20%) | *NB 1DC*  
• *Non-Brand Sauna Blanket PMax* up 40% in revenue | 1.60 ROAS (-33%) | *NB 1DC*  
• *Non-Brand Red Light PMax* up 43% in revenue | 1.58 ROAS (+1%) | *NB 1DC*  
Note: The previous period included the *Body Sculptor launch and Father’s Day sale*, so we’re comparing against an inflated baseline.  
  
**From *Google in-platform data for Pmax* (Jun 19–Jul 10 vs. previous period):**  
• Impressions up 19%  
• Clicks up +35%  
• CTR up +14%  
• CPV down -14%  
• Revenue down -41% (likely due to the stronger comparison period)  
The drop in CPV supports what Google mentioned about PMax leaning more into *Top-of-Funnel placements like YouTube*, which helps build awareness efficiently.  
  
***Recommendation:***  
Let’s maintain current PMax budget levels, given the incremental revenue in 3 of the 5 scaled campaigns and clear improvements in traffic quality.  
  
***Budget note*** cc: @Jourdan @Ingrid:  
We’re currently pacing about **$30K over the $100K Google budget** for July. This was expected, as we committed to running the **30-day PMax scaling test** through its full cycle.  
We’ve noticed that the **influencer platform is under-pacing** against July budgets. Let us know if we can reallocate from there to help absorb the Google overage.  
If you’d like us to **scale further into top-performing PMax campaigns**, we’re happy to — but we’d need an **additional ~$2,800** for the rest of the month to do so.  
Let us know how you'd like us to move forward.  
Thanks! cc: @Berkeley Clark @Jake Panzer @Ari Murray
- **2025-07-18 13:29** *Jourdan*: Hey @Rahul Vithanage thank you for the update and all the context that’s super helpful.  
  
We’re still down 9% YoY and since Google is the primary channel we don’t want to pull back if anything I want to keep pushing budgets on Google since we’re down 23% in spend Last 7.  
  
Do you have insights into why budget is pulling back?  
  
  
CC: @Jake Panzer I also see some under performing campaigns on Meta like PEMF and Sauna Blanket that we could reduce spend on, shift budget to other performing campaigns, or shift the budget to google.  
  
I’d love to know both of your thoughts so we can keep pushing revenue up.  
  
I know we’re up against a few challenges compared to last year but we’re not too far behind on rev.\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*

- **2025-07-24 07:06** *Rahul Vithanage* 💬 7 replies: Hey @Chris Jacob it looks like the recent domain switch might've caused some PDP URLs to change and this has caused a bunch of  disapprovals on GMC. Since the current product feeds are set up through B&T's feedonomics enterprise account, can we have them take a look and pass the updated PDP URLs to GMC? Alternatively, we can set up a supplemental feed with the updated URLs from our end. Let us know how you want to move forward.  
cc: @Jourdan @Ingrid @Ari Murray @Berkeley Clark
- **2025-07-24 09:00** *Rahul Vithanage*: Roger that! @Jourdan I think first order of business is switching the bidding strategy to **"Maximize Conversion Value"** and allowing the campaigns to spend their full budget (~$540/day) and collect 50+ conversions in a 30 day period. During this time, we will definitely see lower efficiency but higher spending and conversions. After the campaigns collect sufficient data in a 30 day period (50+), we can switch to the **"Target ROAS"** bidding strategy to drive efficiency while focusing on maximizing revenue. Let me know if I have the green light to go ahead with the change.

- **2025-07-24 11:26** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Chris Jacob and @Jourdan, sharing through our **search impression share and CPC insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms :relaxed:  
  
**Core Brand - Screenshot 1**  
• Defending brand terms very well with an impression share of over 90%, consistently, for the past 7 weeks  
• CPCs are at an all time low - great news!  
• [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) 's share dropped over the last week. Amazon's drop might be related to the end of the offer there.   
**Sauna Blanket (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 2**  
• We're still the market leader. The gap between our share and competitors' share has widened, indicating strong evergreen performance  
**Red Light Hat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 3**  
• [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) have, once again, managed to become market leaders  
• Our impression share has been a little low consistently as we're dealing with severe competition (possibly with high budgets, bids and lower TROAS).   
• Reduced the Target ROAS Red Light Hat ad group by 20% to try to gain better market share  
• CPCs are reducing which is a solid sign and showcases return to evergreen periods  
**PEMF Mat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 4**  
• Have lost some market share to competitors, possibly due to higher budgets, bids and lower TROAS  
• Added dynamic keyword insertion in all ads under the PEMF ad group for better quality scores (relevance), hoping to win back impression share  
• Reduced the target ROAS of the PEMF ad group by 20% to try to win back market share  
• CPCs are reducing which is a solid sign and showcases return to evergreen periods

- **2025-07-24 16:04** *Jourdan* 💬 3 replies: Hey @Elyse &amp; @Berkeley Clark, I hope you’re both doing well! I’ve been digging into the numbers and we’re only about 1.5 % behind last year’s total sales—so we’re close, but I’d love to give July (and the rest of Q3) an extra push.  
  
I’m especially interested in what more we can do on the retention side. In other brands’ Klaviyo accounts I’m seeing a higher cadence—sometimes daily sends—but obviously that only works when it’s done thoughtfully and doesn’t fatigue the list or hurt deliverability.  
  
Could we  
1. Work towards daily campaign sends?   
2. Brainstorm audience segments we could touch that we haven’t already?  
3. Discuss list-growth opportunities so we can support increased sends ongoing?  
I’m happy to setup a quick sync and pull any data/insights ahead of time. Let me know what would be most helpful! Excited to collaborate and keep the momentum goin

The wholesale is lumpy because we don't get clean sell through data for everyone so a lot of data is based on when we large/bulk ship a PO  
In that regard I would look more at rolling 12 month columns than each individual month

I have little notion of this and I think it can help inform a lot because, as examples  
• Blanket and Go Mat are same priced products - but very different maturity, ability for customer to understand, etc - what's our relative cost to convert?  
• A Pro Mat drops 3.2x a mask to the bottom line - I doubt it costs 3x spend to convert but even if it does the contribution margin gap is enormous

Summary of optis:  
• Updated campaign objectives to "Sales" across Brand and Non-Brand Search to better align with performance goals.  
• Switched bidding strategies of two Brand Search campaigns to automated bidding across to drive scale.  
• Paused the underperforming Brand Sale ad group (0 revenue L60D) under US*Brand*Core campaign  
• Scaled budgets across top-performing campaigns to capture incremental revenue:  
    ◦ +10% on PMax Brand All Products &amp; PMax Non-Brand Sauna Blanket  
    ◦ +20% on PMax Brand Consumables &amp; PMax Non-Brand PEMF  
    ◦ +20% on Non-Brand Products Search  
• Reduced budget on PMax Non-Brand Red Light by 20% due to underperformance  
• Scaled down the three main Brand Search campaigns by 20% to assess top-line revenue impact.  
• Optimized all non-brand campaigns to bid exclusively on new customers (vs. just bidding higher).  
• Excluded brand terms from non-brand search campaigns.  
• Further scaled down US*PMax*NonBrand*RedLight by 20% — previous Apr 4 scale-down drove ROAS improvement without impacting revenue.  
• Paused poor-performing keywords in US*NonBrand*Concern that spent significantly without generating meaningful revenue over the last 60 days.  
• Paused low-performing ad in NonBrand*Concern*RedLightMask ad group to prioritize top-performing creative.

Actions taken and points for next week  
• Turned off underperformers in original SPC. Leaving only the top performers there to get everything we can out of them  
• Duped the SPC and kept only the creatives that had not gotten any spend to test if any of those are winners  
• Checked for usage rights and turned off the expired one  
• Working with Chandler and Blake to kickoff shop on the right foot. Would love to get something on the calendar with them for intros and learning  
• Start building true campaign structure as we get creative in

- **2025-04-14 16:11** *Ingrid*: Also, I'm worried we are not spending enough to meet/exceed those LY numbers - my suggestion is spending more on Meta where we have an efficient ROAS to at least 10% more than we spent last year.

- **2025-04-16 10:50** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Ingrid, apologies for the delay in sending this through but here's the **non-brand search impression share by product** along w/ some insights to consider.  
  
**Screenshot 1 -  Sauna Blanket**  
• CPCs hovering around $3 - $4  
• Our impression share is the best in the space and is around 30% on average  
• With new ad copy coming in, designed to improve strength and keyword-relevance, we're hoping to see impression share grow further.   
**Screenshot 2 -  Red Light Hat**  
• CPCs hovering around $4.5 - $8. Slightly volatile. More competitors in the space  
• There was a hike in CPCs during the week of Mar 3 - Mar 24. The green competitor ([illumiflow.com](http://illumiflow.com)) seems to have had an impact there.   
• More importantly, the red competitor ([irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com)) has had higher impression share in the red light hat space consistently, so we'll be taking a few pointers from them for our new hat search ad copy.   
**Screenshot 3 -  PEMF**   
• CPCs hovering around a $3.70- $4.40. Seeing a rise from week of Mar 24 - Apr 7.  
• We're slowly starting to loose impression share while Amazon is slowly gaining.   
• For our new PEMF search ad copy, we'll be sure to take some pointers from amazon.   
Let me know if you have any thoughts / insights I might've missed. Thank you!

- **2025-04-18 12:36** *User_TS27JN*: Hey @Ingrid happy Friday! Two quick questions for you. Performance has been good on the platform and in order to test creatives fully and continue growth we'd like to increase our daily budget. We have kept where it was before taking over, but would love to have the go ahead for another $350 in daily spend (we are currently around $825 daily). That would add $4200 to the tiktok monthly budget for april. Second, I know we spoke about making sure the copy matches the creatives yesterday. While using this current campaign type tiktok assigns the copy and given its performance we would like to avoid shutting it down. With your permission we'd like to leave this one live and have our team whip up some more evergreen copy for the future!

- **2025-04-29 10:21** *User_TS27JN*: Hi @Ingrid and team here are Tiktok updates for the week. We did a look back of MoM as opposed to YoY due to the low spend in 2024.  
High level updates:  
• Chris is planning to upload category authorization documentation for shop. We will take over effectively completely from there in terms of set up and shop ad management. Affiliate split to come as we continue building the account and are in a stable place shop wise.   
Whats next:  
• Our plan is to test 2-3 creative ideas at a time at a high spend as opposed to spreading the account thin given high CAC high AOV.  This will help us be more intentional about learnings and hopefully speed up that process. While we do creative test the account will continue seeing performance fluctuation.   
    ◦ With that we are building a testing schedule for easy visibility/tracking (this will include various campaign types including manual, SPC, and search as well as the creative testing idea itself). We'll provide benchmarks for each test in this doc too.   
• We are slowly testing and phasing out the non sparked SPCs as creative fatigues, but definitely want to take advantage of some really great creative currently in the account while we can (heavy sauna blanket before it goes out of season completely).

- **2025-05-05 11:09** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hi @Ingrid, we wanted to share this with you directly before looping in the broader email thread with the Google reps. In short, we don't recommend scaling too much further in this time, given where we are at with efficiency. Often, we find reps try to push the limits of spend, so wanted to share the numbers below:  
  
• Last year (Apr 19–24, 2024), during the first six days of the Mother’s Day Sale, we spent $31,565.29 and generated $215,841.11 in revenue for a **ROAS of 6.84 and CPA of $92.53.**  
• This year (Apr 29–May 4, 2025), we spent $58,063.39 (+84% YoY) and drove $306,123.38 in revenue (+42% YoY), with a ROAS of 5.27 (-23% YoY) and a CPA of $110.72 (+20% YoY). These figures include late attribution.  
With scaling thus far, we've achieved incremental revenue at reduced efficiency. However, if we push further we would be risking an even lower ROAS and higher CAC and in this case, we would recommend holding steady with spend today or finding a middle ground.  
  
We also don't recommend maintaining elevated budgets after the initial sales phase ends as we expect efficiency to drop dramatically, but will hike back up again over next weekend. Let us know if you are aligned here - or prefer to push forward for topline growth in this time.  
Thanks!

This just continues to confirm the idea of tiktok's lift into other channels as opposed to purely in platform purchases.

**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPCs hovering in the normal range ~$3  
• Amazon's impression share rose quite significantly last week. This might be due to heavy investment on brand terms during the Mother's Day Sale but we're eager to hear your insights here  
• Dermstore's impression share stands at 15.21% (below than the max target of 20% we've given them) although it did increase slightly WoW  
**General non-brand insights**   
• CPC's have spiked quite a bit last week for non-brand / product terms, especially against the red light hat. We believe that this might be an impact due to heavy competition / investment during the Mother's Day Sale period.   
• We'll report back by next week on whether CPCs normalize but we think there might be a few weeks of high CPCs due to the sale season this month (Mother's Day and Memorial Day)  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• We managed to improve impression share last week along with [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com) despite rising CPCs  
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• Our impression share has consistently been low in this space. We're aiming to share new ad copy for review by early next week in order to combat this

We're setting up a call with the Google tag team on this subject but we require a member from your team that has the **highest level of access** to **Shopify, Google Ads, GA4, GMC and GTM** to also be on the call**.** Let us know who this might be and we can go ahead and schedule the call with the Google team.

- **2025-05-08 15:11** *Rahul Vithanage* 💬 4 replies: Hi @Ingrid, we’ve connected with our Google reps, Tori and Casey, regarding a preliminary **Demand Gen (YouTube) investment plan.** While their initial recommendation was a $100K/month budget ($3,333/day) to drive statistically significant learnings, we flagged that as outside our scope and asked for a more realistic alternative.  
They’ve since shared the attached plan, which outlines a "crawl, walk, run" approach to budget scaling. While our original recommendation was $7,500/month ($250/day), the minimum viable spend in their framework—the “crawl” scenario—is set at **$15K/month ($500/day).** Given this is the **lowest tier that still ensures meaningful learnings,** we believe it makes sense to move forward at that level.  
In terms of **performance measurement,** Google suggested methods such as a **search lift study (only eligible at a $1000/day budget) and accounting for view-through conversions** among other things, which are outlined in the **“Holistic Measurement Framework”** section of their plan.  
One thing to call out: we may see a **dip in overall account efficiency** by launching this campaign at a $500/day budget or more. Since Demand Gen focuses on **upper-funnel objectives** like awareness and consideration, we **shouldn’t expect it to perform on the same metrics as Search, Shopping, or PMax.** For that reason, we recommend **reporting on Demand Gen performance separately**, as it will likely contribute to downstream conversions across other campaigns or organic channels.

- **2025-05-14 11:36** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through the weekly **search impression share insights** for **brand** and **non-brand (product) terms** :relaxed:  
  
**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPCs have increased. Corresponds to a rise in impression share by [dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com), [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) and [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com).  
• This could be a result of these **competitors investing heavily** across the board during their **Mother's Day promos**.  
• [dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com) **surpassed the maximum target impression share** we've provided them (20%) last week. Stood at 32%. We recommend **escalating this** to them right away.  
• Finally, [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) has been increasingly bidding on our branded terms and captured the **best impression share among all competitors** last week. We'll keep a close eye here.  
**General non-brand insights**  
• CPCs fell last week but still high.  
• As mentioned in last week's update, we're seeing **CPCs trending up starting from the week of 4/21** which corresponds to increased competition in the ad auction heading into MD.  
• We might notice **higher CPCs** towards the latter part of the month as well due to **increased competition during MDW**  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com)'s impression share rose significantly last week while [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) also managed to increase impression share slightly  
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• Impression share of market leaders like [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) are falling while new brands like [currentbody.ca](http://currentbody.ca), [schoolofdermatology.com](http://schoolofdermatology.com) and [omniluxled.com](http://omniluxled.com) have recently started gaining impression share.  
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• Over the last 2 weeks, we've managed to increase our impression share (which we were losing earlier to others). New copy should help us improve this further.

**Core Brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPC's have normalized last week as expected, being the week after Mother's Day week  
• **[dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com) still bidding high** on our **brand terms surpassing the max. impression share** we've provided them for the second week in a row. We should ideally escalate ASAP!   
• [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) still having a relatively high impression share  
**Sauna Blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• CPC's have dropped last week as expected, being the week after Mother's Day week. It fell below the general average of ~$3.6 - $4.  
• While we managed to improve our impression share over the last 2 weeks, so has [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com). So did [instyle.com](http://instyle.com) and [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) over last week.  
• We also launched new Sharma ad copy under this non-brand ad group on 5/15 and are hoping to see some good impression share results over the next few weeks.    
**Red Light Hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• CPC's have normalized last week as expected, being the week after Mother's Day week  
• Market leaders [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) managed to improve impression share quite a bit last week along with us.   
**PEMF Mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• CPCs have remained elevated last week, in contrast to other search ad groups, and are likely to stay high this week and the next due to MDW  
• We have lost impression share last week although we were gaining in the previous two weeks (probably due to high spending for MD sale). Competitors like [oxfordmedicals.com](http://oxfordmedicals.com), [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com), [magnawavepemf.com](http://magnawavepemf.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) have gained IS quite a bit last week. To address this, new ad copy will be prioritized for this ad group next week (after the MDW sale). Aiming to share for review by end of next week. cc: @User*7DB7H9 @User*PT7LCE

**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPC's interestingly fell well below average last week!   
• This might be due to several factors:  
    ◦ Competitors like [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) losing impression share  
    ◦ Our impression share improving to over 99%   
    ◦ Last week, despite scaling brand search (along with all other campaigns) for the MDW sale, our spending for core brand terms reduced while clicks increased. This means we drove very efficient brand clicks due to our promo last week.   
• [dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com) is still having an impression share that's higher than 20% for our brand terms (at 32.21%), although, it didn't have much of an impact on our costs last week due to points mentioned above. We'll evaluate their impression share and the impact on our CPCs next week and report back on where they stand and if they are still influencing our brand search costs.  
• Finally, we didn't notice other brands receiving an impression share against our brand terms last week despite running offers with certain retailers.  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• CPCs increased last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• Interestingly, competitor impression share dropped last week and our impression share grew, which was quite a positive trend to see!   
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• CPCs increased last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• Market leaders ([irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com)) as well as HD and [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com), were able to improve impression share last week.  
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• CPCs remained high last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• On a positive note, our impression share grew with scaling and we were able to beat out competitors that were catching up to us the week before last.   
• **New Sharma ad copy for PEMF** aimed at improving ad relevance / quality scores and impression share will be shared for review **this week.** [cc: @User_7DB7H9] This copy will help us maintain a good impression share vs. competitors going into an evergreen period while scaling down campaigns.

- **2025-06-04 14:25** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hi @Chris Jacob @Ingrid, here's a quick recap from today’s ***Google tag call:***  
• **Google Ads tracking** is confirmed to be working correctly via a test purchase.  
• For **GA4 tracking**, the rep said the current setup is fine, but asked us to check with your dev team / the team that set it up:  
    ◦ If they’re happy with the existing setup and recommend we continue with it. In this case, no further action is needed.  
    ◦ If they prefer / recommend switching to the new Shopify Google &amp; YouTube app setup. In this case, we can proceed—but we’ll need to **remove the current setup** to avoid duplicate conversions *afterwards*.  
Let me know what your team recommends. Also, it's important to not remove any set ups as of now, until we hear back from the team on the above.

- **2025-06-04 15:52** *Rahul Vithanage* 💬 4 replies: Hey @Ingrid, given the reduced paid media budget this month, we don’t currently have the capacity to test into Demand Gen/YouTube—though we’re definitely eager to explore it, as we believe it has strong potential!  
Right now, the entire Google budget is being used to support existing campaigns, so there’s no room to layer in YouTube within the current allocation.  
Google recommends a **$500/day** minimum for meaningful results (≈**$15K/month**), but if we want to stay budget-conscious, we could start with **$300/day** (≈**$9K/month**).  
Let us know if this incremental budget for YT is possible for June, or if you'd prefer we revisit it next month.  
Thanks! cc: @Ari Murray @Berkeley Clark
- **2025-06-05 09:58** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through the weekly **search impression share insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms :relaxed:  
  
**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• Our impression share dropped off a bit last week (Generally 95%+ but last week it came down to 85%+). This is a result of us scaling down significantly last week to maintain efficiency during the last few days of the sale.   
• No cause for concern here since over the L7D, impression share is once again up to a 97.23% as we returned to an evergreen state.   
• Also happy to report that over the last two weeks, CPCs have trended down vs. evergreen (generally around $3). This could be the impact of us pushing dermstore to reduce bids and budgets for our brand keywords. cc: @Chris Jacob   
**General non-brand insights**  
• CPCs are still high last week vs. evergreen. This was expected due to most MDW sales bleeding into last week (high ad auction competition during MD).   
• We're expecting CPCs to drop off from this week (6/2) as we return to a fully evergreen state.  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• Over the last 4 weeks, [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com) seems to have improved their impression share which could be an indicator that they are bidding more into / scaling into sauna blanket terms, especially during sale periods.   
• Nevertheless, we're still the market leader and we expect to stay at this level as we return to an evergreen state while also having launched new ad copy which seems to be performing better vs. older copy.   
• We'll also ensure to scale if required to maintain our position as the market leader.   
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) still remain market leaders while [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com) also managed to improve their impression share last week, most likely due to high spending during Memorial Day.  
• We're planning on working on new ad copy under this ad group, which should allow us to improve our impression share and catch up to the market leaders during an evergreen state.   
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• We remain as market leaders in the space and are aiming to get copy launched soon (once approved) in order to improve our impression share further over the next few weeks.

- **2025-06-13 07:46** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing this week’s Google Search impression share and CPC update for brand and non-brand (product) terms :blush:  
  
**Core Brand (screenshot 1)**  
• We bounced back from the slight dip in impression share seen during the tail end of the MDW sale, now sitting strong at **97.86%** once again last week (up from 86.19% previous week).  
• What’s even better -- **CPCs dropped further** to **$1.43**, the lowest in over 2 months. This downward CPC trend started in the week of 5/19 and may still be influenced by reduced competition from Dermstore on branded terms. cc: @Chris Jacob  
**Sauna Blanket Non-Brand (screenshot 2)**  
• Our **impression share improved slightly to 38.78%** last week (from 35.08% the previous week), while **CPCs dropped from $5.07 to $3.82**—a positive shift post-sale, as expected, as we head into evergreen.  
• [Hydragun.com](http://Hydragun.com) remains aggressive, still above 30% IS, but we’re continuing to lead. New Sharma copy may be helping us stay in the lead here.  
**Red Light Hat Non-Brand (screenshot 3)**  
• Impression share dipped to **15.53%** last week (vs. 19.04% the previous week), likely from the effects of returning to an evergreen state *with reduced budgets* in June.  
• **CPCs came down slightly** from $7.71 to **$6.90**, which is a step in the right direction post-sale but we expect it to reduce further / normalize over the next few weeks during evergreen.   
**PEMF Mat Non-Brand (screenshot 4)**  
• Holding relatively steady with a **22.10% impression share**, just a minor drop from last week.  
• **CPCs also dropped** to **$5.01**, down from $5.82 post sale, as expected. We expect this to reduce further / normalize over the next few weeks during evergreen.   
• Thanks for approving the new PEMF search copy. Once this is launched, we expect to improve IS and improve our lead against competitors.

**Tiktok Performance L7 (6/16-6/22)**  
1DC Northbeam  
$6,760 (NC)  
ROAS: 0.18 (+251% WoW)  
Revenue: $1,220 (+250% WoW)  
CAC: $2,250 (-66.73% WoW)  
  
Updates and next steps  
• The low AOV product funnel is fully built out and has been spending since Friday  
    ◦ NB shows a .11 roas overall with a .21 roas in the retargeting ad group. This has started off slowly and we’re making adjustments this week. If we do not see significant improvement by the end of the week we’ll look to end this test   
• Our next test is to focus heavily on the high aov products as opposed to the low aov ones and segment these out closely  
• We are preparing to move body sculpt to a conversion focused campaign in July as well. The traffic campaign has been excellent so far with a .22 CPC and a CTR of 2.62.

**Core Brand - Screenshot 1**  
• Impression share dropped to 91.91% in week 6/9. Correlates to scaling down post Father's Day sale on Jun 10.   
• Rose to **94.40% last week** most likely as a response to scaling back up based on Google rep recommendations   
• Staying strong above 90% for 7 of the past 8 weeks.  
• CPCs remain very efficient at **$1.68**, down significantly from early May highs. It has been under $2 since week 5/19 -- correlates to when dermstore confirmed they've been bidding less on our brand terms.   
• Key competitors (**Dermstore**, **Hydragun**) have pulled back / lost impression share over the last couple of weeks.  
• Amazon however increased their impression share over the last 2 weeks  
• Brand terms are well-defended with low CPCs, high impression share :white*check*mark:  
**Sauna Blanket (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 2**  
• Impression share rose to **33.41% last week**, recovering slightly from previous week’s dip -- most likely due to scaling down in week 6/9 and scaling back up in week 6/16.  
• CPCs dropped to **$4.66 last week**, down from $5.38 (Father's Day Sale week, 5/9) — a good sign of improving efficiency during an evergreen state although it hasn't reached true evergreen levels yet.  
• **Hydragun** remains our main competitor but is also trending down. **Amazon** managed to gain impression share over the last two weeks.  
• We have a decent lead, but still below May peak. This is most likely as we've scaled down dramatically in June.   
**Red Light Hat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 3**  
• **iRestore** and **Kiierr** continue to dominate the space.  
• Our share edged up to **11.41% last week**, but still far below the **31%** peak in week 5/9, likely due to scaling down significantly in June.  
• CPCs improved to **$6.08 last week**, down from over $10 in week 4/28. Slowly stabilizing post sales although it hasn't reached true evergreen levels yet.   
• **New Red Light Hat search copy** was launched this week and we expect to see an improvement in our share over the next few weeks.   
**PEMF Mat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 4**  
• Slight rise in share to **21.43% last week**, but still below earlier highs. Competitors, **Magnawavepemf** and **Healthnews** gaining ground. Likely due to scaling down significantly in June.  
• **New PEMF search copy** launched this week and we expect to see an improvement in our share over the next few weeks. We should also ideally think of scaling here to recapture impression share.   
• CPCs stable at **$5.05**, within recent averages. \n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.18.16 PM.png** (png, 418.2KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093F0GP329/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.18.16_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.18.51 PM.png** (png, 505.5KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093WFE289X/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.18.51_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.19.14 PM.png** (png, 550.7KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093F0H9W2Z/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.19.14_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.19.34 PM.png** (png, 524.0KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093BF2SGQN/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.19.34_pm.png)

**Revenue: $804**  
**ROAS: .13** (-35.58%)  
**CAC: $3,100 (+30.90%)**   
Updates and next steps  
• The body sculpt focused funnel has started off well both in platform and in NB.  
    ◦ In platform: 4.54 ROAS $73 CAC  
    ◦ NB clicks only: .68 ROAS   
    ◦ Awareness metrics: 62.3% LP view rate, .72 CPC. We will look to refresh this campaign to keep driving these metrics   
• In the pipeline is our full high aov product funnel  
    ◦ We'll launch this if body sculpt falls off/budget supports!  
Traffic campaigns in June (Roughly 12% of spend this week)  
• .35 CPC, 1.56% CTR and a Landing page view rate 66.14%  
[Creative Report](https://projects.motionapp.com/snapshot/1c57f4ef-091a-473c-9802-ac496beffacb)  
• 027 V4 is our top performer in platform and on NB. The sound and text overlay are both key factors here. The background sound is consistent in the top performing body sculpt creatives 
- **2025-07-09 09:09** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through our **search impression share and CPC insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms.  
  
**Core Brand - Screenshot 1**  
• Defending brand terms very well with an impression share consistently over 90%, over the last 8+ weeks.  
• [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) have increased impression share over the last 4 weeks, indicating higher bidding on our brand terms.   
**Sauna Blanket (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 2**  
• Defending market share well - still the market leader. [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) is our main competitor in the space.   
• CPCs seem to be normalizing over the last 3 weeks, showcasing a slow return to an evergreen state  
**Red Light Hat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 3**  
• Market leaders [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) have seen a significant drop in impression share over the last 2 weeks. Possibly due to scaling down drastically post promos. Showcases a need to scale significantly during sale periods to remain competitive with them.  
• Competitors like [schoolofdermatology.com](http://schoolofdermatology.com) and [omniluxled.com](http://omniluxled.com) have managed to improve their share in the space and a new competitor has entered the auction house ([hoogahealth.com](http://hoogahealth.com))   
• We want to scale this campaign by 20% this week to assess if we can capture some additional impression share, traffic and conversions.   
**PEMF Mat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 4**  
• We remain market leaders in the space despite scaling down drastically in June. This indicates strong performance during evergreen periods. We also recently launched new ad copy under the PEMF ad group aimed at improving quality scores and impression share which seems to be working well in defending our share.   
• [magnawavepemf.com](http://magnawavepemf.com) remains our biggest competitor in the space.   
• CPCs are dropping / stabilizing, indicating a slow return to an evergreen state.

- **2025-07-10 09:20** *Rahul Vithanage* 💬 5 replies: Hey @Ingrid (cc: @Jourdan), we met with our Google rep Tori yesterday and here’s what we aligned on—sharing for visibility:  
• We’ll let the **Pmax scaling test** run for 30 days (from June 19 until July 18), then scale down any campaigns that aren’t driving incremental revenue post scale.  
 • On July 12 (after Prime Day), we’ll **increase the target ROAS** on one Pmax campaign by +15% and monitor for around 2 weeks before deciding whether to roll this out to other campaigns.  
 • **Demand Gen scaling to $500/day** will realistically need about 6 weeks for proper learning according to Tori. Let us know if you guys are down to up the budget to $500/day from the current $300/day.  
 • Waiting on Tori to confirm what the **ToF YT Reach/Traffic investment** will look like.

- **2025-07-10 10:58** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Jourdan and team, our Shopping campaign has had a bit of drop off in spends and revenue recently, so I did a little digging and noticed that *bundles* were the primary cause. I believe the bundle images which are synced to GMC showcases the evergreen offer, and because of this, GMC has disapproved those SKUs as promotional imagery is not allowed in Google Shopping placements. Would you guys be able to provide <mailto:rahul@sharmabrands.com|rahul@sharmabrands.com> and <mailto:berkeley@sharmabrands.com|berkeley@sharmabrands.com> admin access to your GMC, and also provide us alternate image links for each bundle that's live on-site, which doesn't showcase the offer?  
Thanks in advance!

I've managed to get most of our bundles approved on GMC, which were previously flagged as having promotional imagery and were disapproved. The fix of adding a supplemental feed with the new image links (without the promo stickers) worked :relaxed:  
  
The Sauna Blanket Starter Kit is still disapproved but I have requested a review from GMC. Will keep an eye here and let you guys know once it's approved too.  
  
I also noticed that the Summer Travel Glow Kit is missing on GMC. I can work on getting it added although I might need some clarity as to who manages the current product feeds on GMC. I've attached a screenshot of the feeds (data sources) connected to GMC. Once I know who currently manages them, I can work closely with them to get the new bundle added and make any further optis.

- **2025-07-18 12:07** *Rahul Vithanage* 💬 11 replies: Hey @Jourdan @Ingrid – sharing a quick update on the ***PMax scaling test***, since today marks the end of the 30-day test window (June 19 to July 17).  
  
*Overall, scaling results look promising.*  
**Here’s a breakdown based on *Northbeam 1DC data* (Jun 19–Jul 17 vs. previous period):**  
• *Non-Brand PEMF PMax* up 131% in revenue | 1.68 ROAS (+20%) | *NB 1DC*  
• *Non-Brand Sauna Blanket PMax* up 40% in revenue | 1.60 ROAS (-33%) | *NB 1DC*  
• *Non-Brand Red Light PMax* up 43% in revenue | 1.58 ROAS (+1%) | *NB 1DC*  
Note: The previous period included the *Body Sculptor launch and Father’s Day sale*, so we’re comparing against an inflated baseline.  
  
**From *Google in-platform data for Pmax* (Jun 19–Jul 10 vs. previous period):**  
• Impressions up 19%  
• Clicks up +35%  
• CTR up +14%  
• CPV down -14%  
• Revenue down -41% (likely due to the stronger comparison period)  
The drop in CPV supports what Google mentioned about PMax leaning more into *Top-of-Funnel placements like YouTube*, which helps build awareness efficiently.  
  
***Recommendation:***  
Let’s maintain current PMax budget levels, given the incremental revenue in 3 of the 5 scaled campaigns and clear improvements in traffic quality.  
  
***Budget note*** cc: @Jourdan @Ingrid:  
We’re currently pacing about **$30K over the $100K Google budget** for July. This was expected, as we committed to running the **30-day PMax scaling test** through its full cycle.  
We’ve noticed that the **influencer platform is under-pacing** against July budgets. Let us know if we can reallocate from there to help absorb the Google overage.  
If you’d like us to **scale further into top-performing PMax campaigns**, we’re happy to — but we’d need an **additional ~$2,800** for the rest of the month to do so.  
Let us know how you'd like us to move forward.  
Thanks! cc: @Berkeley Clark @Jake Panzer @Ari Murray
- **2025-07-18 13:29** *Jourdan*: Hey @Rahul Vithanage thank you for the update and all the context that’s super helpful.  
  
We’re still down 9% YoY and since Google is the primary channel we don’t want to pull back if anything I want to keep pushing budgets on Google since we’re down 23% in spend Last 7.  
  
Do you have insights into why budget is pulling back?  
  
  
CC: @Jake Panzer I also see some under performing campaigns on Meta like PEMF and Sauna Blanket that we could reduce spend on, shift budget to other performing campaigns, or shift the budget to google.  
  
I’d love to know both of your thoughts so we can keep pushing revenue up.  
  
I know we’re up against a few challenges compared to last year but we’re not too far behind on rev.\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*

- **2025-07-24 09:00** *Rahul Vithanage*: Roger that! @Jourdan I think first order of business is switching the bidding strategy to **"Maximize Conversion Value"** and allowing the campaigns to spend their full budget (~$540/day) and collect 50+ conversions in a 30 day period. During this time, we will definitely see lower efficiency but higher spending and conversions. After the campaigns collect sufficient data in a 30 day period (50+), we can switch to the **"Target ROAS"** bidding strategy to drive efficiency while focusing on maximizing revenue. Let me know if I have the green light to go ahead with the change.

- **2025-07-24 11:26** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Chris Jacob and @Jourdan, sharing through our **search impression share and CPC insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms :relaxed:  
  
**Core Brand - Screenshot 1**  
• Defending brand terms very well with an impression share of over 90%, consistently, for the past 7 weeks  
• CPCs are at an all time low - great news!  
• [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) 's share dropped over the last week. Amazon's drop might be related to the end of the offer there.   
**Sauna Blanket (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 2**  
• We're still the market leader. The gap between our share and competitors' share has widened, indicating strong evergreen performance  
**Red Light Hat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 3**  
• [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) have, once again, managed to become market leaders  
• Our impression share has been a little low consistently as we're dealing with severe competition (possibly with high budgets, bids and lower TROAS).   
• Reduced the Target ROAS Red Light Hat ad group by 20% to try to gain better market share  
• CPCs are reducing which is a solid sign and showcases return to evergreen periods  
**PEMF Mat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 4**  
• Have lost some market share to competitors, possibly due to higher budgets, bids and lower TROAS  
• Added dynamic keyword insertion in all ads under the PEMF ad group for better quality scores (relevance), hoping to win back impression share  
• Reduced the target ROAS of the PEMF ad group by 20% to try to win back market share  
• CPCs are reducing which is a solid sign and showcases return to evergreen periods

- **2025-07-24 16:04** *Jourdan* 💬 6 replies: Hey @Elyse &amp; @Berkeley Clark, I hope you’re both doing well! I’ve been digging into the numbers and we’re only about 1.5 % behind last year’s total sales—so we’re close, but I’d love to give July (and the rest of Q3) an extra push.  
  
I’m especially interested in what more we can do on the retention side. In other brands’ Klaviyo accounts I’m seeing a higher cadence—sometimes daily sends—but obviously that only works when it’s done thoughtfully and doesn’t fatigue the list or hurt deliverability.  
  
Could we  
1. Work towards daily campaign sends?   
2. Brainstorm audience segments we could touch that we haven’t already?  
3. Discuss list-growth opportunities so we can support increased sends ongoing?  
I’m happy to setup a quick sync and pull any data/insights ahead of time. Let me know what would be most helpful! Excited to collaborate and keep the momentum goin

The wholesale is lumpy because we don't get clean sell through data for everyone so a lot of data is based on when we large/bulk ship a PO  
In that regard I would look more at rolling 12 month columns than each individual month  
  
This is broken by underlying product (so a bundle is counted as one unit each of the component parts)\n\n📎 **Sell Through_March 2025.xlsx** (xlsx, 176.0KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F08LELCJVTL/sell_through_march_2025.xlsx)

- **2025-04-10 11:58** *Chris Jacob*: <!channel> i took a prescheduled call with Northbeam reps  
• They are available to Sharma for whatever if rollover help is needed  
• They are still failing to correctly clear out $0 order (we use for marketing comps and warranty replacements)  
• This affects anything in NB that relies on order count like AOV
- **2025-04-10 12:02** *Berkeley Clark* 💬 3 replies: @Chris Jacob We would love to attend that call and help move things along! We can also shoot through an urgent message right now to reps on our side to see if we can get the $0 orders resolved more quickly.
- **2025-04-10 15:40** *Chris Jacob*: <!channel> related to call just now it would be helpful to see if any info (even if imperfect) we have to date - few months of Northbeam, Motion, whatever - can inform any sense of the relative costs of converting into a sale of different products  
  
I have little notion of this and I think it can help inform a lot because, as examples  
• Blanket and Go Mat are same priced products - but very different maturity, ability for customer to understand, etc - what's our relative cost to convert?  
• A Pro Mat drops 3.2x a mask to the bottom line - I doubt it costs 3x spend to convert but even if it does the contribution margin gap is enormous

• Strong week in performance with ROAS and CAC both improving heavily in the account which resulted in a 14% revenue increase.  
• The main contributor in terms of revenue gained in the account was the Red Light Products ASC and the following ad drove home nearly 50% of attributed revenue for the campaign.

• In terms of ROAS, the volume DABA campaign lead the way with a 8.24x ROAS.  
• This is a trend we are seeing in the Meta accounts recently where catalog ads are performing at a very high efficiency level compared to normal ad sets. With this in mind, we are looking at scaling where possible to keep up with the momentum.  
• Net new actions taken this week was the launch of the TOF Sauna Blanket creative testing campaign. Along with the Oprah ads, we are launching the first set of SB ads into this campaign today.  
• Along with this, we are also going to be launching the Red Light TOF creative testing campaign today too, heading into the weekend.  
[Best Performing Creative](https://projects.motionapp.com/snapshot/67f944b0c76352823f443bd1)

Summary of optis:  
• Updated campaign objectives to "Sales" across Brand and Non-Brand Search to better align with performance goals.  
• Switched bidding strategies of two Brand Search campaigns to automated bidding across to drive scale.  
• Paused the underperforming Brand Sale ad group (0 revenue L60D) under US*Brand*Core campaign  
• Scaled budgets across top-performing campaigns to capture incremental revenue:  
    ◦ +10% on PMax Brand All Products &amp; PMax Non-Brand Sauna Blanket  
    ◦ +20% on PMax Brand Consumables &amp; PMax Non-Brand PEMF  
    ◦ +20% on Non-Brand Products Search  
• Reduced budget on PMax Non-Brand Red Light by 20% due to underperformance  
• Scaled down the three main Brand Search campaigns by 20% to assess top-line revenue impact.  
• Optimized all non-brand campaigns to bid exclusively on new customers (vs. just bidding higher).  
• Excluded brand terms from non-brand search campaigns.  
• Further scaled down US*PMax*NonBrand*RedLight by 20% — previous Apr 4 scale-down drove ROAS improvement without impacting revenue.  
• Paused poor-performing keywords in US*NonBrand*Concern that spent significantly without generating meaningful revenue over the last 60 days.  
• Paused low-performing ad in NonBrand*Concern*RedLightMask ad group to prioritize top-performing creative.

Actions taken and points for next week  
• Turned off underperformers in original SPC. Leaving only the top performers there to get everything we can out of them  
• Duped the SPC and kept only the creatives that had not gotten any spend to test if any of those are winners  
• Checked for usage rights and turned off the expired one  
• Working with Chandler and Blake to kickoff shop on the right foot. Would love to get something on the calendar with them for intros and learning  
• Start building true campaign structure as we get creative in

- **2025-04-16 10:50** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Ingrid, apologies for the delay in sending this through but here's the **non-brand search impression share by product** along w/ some insights to consider.  
  
**Screenshot 1 -  Sauna Blanket**  
• CPCs hovering around $3 - $4  
• Our impression share is the best in the space and is around 30% on average  
• With new ad copy coming in, designed to improve strength and keyword-relevance, we're hoping to see impression share grow further.   
**Screenshot 2 -  Red Light Hat**  
• CPCs hovering around $4.5 - $8. Slightly volatile. More competitors in the space  
• There was a hike in CPCs during the week of Mar 3 - Mar 24. The green competitor ([illumiflow.com](http://illumiflow.com)) seems to have had an impact there.   
• More importantly, the red competitor ([irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com)) has had higher impression share in the red light hat space consistently, so we'll be taking a few pointers from them for our new hat search ad copy.   
**Screenshot 3 -  PEMF**   
• CPCs hovering around a $3.70- $4.40. Seeing a rise from week of Mar 24 - Apr 7.  
• We're slowly starting to loose impression share while Amazon is slowly gaining.   
• For our new PEMF search ad copy, we'll be sure to take some pointers from amazon.   
Let me know if you have any thoughts / insights I might've missed. Thank you!

- **2025-04-18 12:36** *User_TS27JN*: Hey @Ingrid happy Friday! Two quick questions for you. Performance has been good on the platform and in order to test creatives fully and continue growth we'd like to increase our daily budget. We have kept where it was before taking over, but would love to have the go ahead for another $350 in daily spend (we are currently around $825 daily). That would add $4200 to the tiktok monthly budget for april. Second, I know we spoke about making sure the copy matches the creatives yesterday. While using this current campaign type tiktok assigns the copy and given its performance we would like to avoid shutting it down. With your permission we'd like to leave this one live and have our team whip up some more evergreen copy for the future! Thank you and have a great weekend CC @Berkeley Clark\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-04-18 at 1.18.59 PM.png** (png, 742.1KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F08NXA52J4U/screenshot_2025-04-18_at_1.18.59___pm.png)

- **2025-04-29 10:21** *User_TS27JN*: Hi @Ingrid and team here are Tiktok updates for the week. We did a look back of MoM as opposed to YoY due to the low spend in 2024.  
High level updates:  
• Chris is planning to upload category authorization documentation for shop. We will take over effectively completely from there in terms of set up and shop ad management. Affiliate split to come as we continue building the account and are in a stable place shop wise.   
Whats next:  
• Our plan is to test 2-3 creative ideas at a time at a high spend as opposed to spreading the account thin given high CAC high AOV.  This will help us be more intentional about learnings and hopefully speed up that process. While we do creative test the account will continue seeing performance fluctuation.   
    ◦ With that we are building a testing schedule for easy visibility/tracking (this will include various campaign types including manual, SPC, and search as well as the creative testing idea itself). We'll provide benchmarks for each test in this doc too.   
• We are slowly testing and phasing out the non sparked SPCs as creative fatigues, but definitely want to take advantage of some really great creative currently in the account while we can (heavy sauna blanket before it goes out of season completely).

- **2025-05-05 11:09** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hi @Ingrid, we wanted to share this with you directly before looping in the broader email thread with the Google reps. In short, we don't recommend scaling too much further in this time, given where we are at with efficiency. Often, we find reps try to push the limits of spend, so wanted to share the numbers below:  
  
• Last year (Apr 19–24, 2024), during the first six days of the Mother’s Day Sale, we spent $31,565.29 and generated $215,841.11 in revenue for a **ROAS of 6.84 and CPA of $92.53.**  
• This year (Apr 29–May 4, 2025), we spent $58,063.39 (+84% YoY) and drove $306,123.38 in revenue (+42% YoY), with a ROAS of 5.27 (-23% YoY) and a CPA of $110.72 (+20% YoY). These figures include late attribution.  
With scaling thus far, we've achieved incremental revenue at reduced efficiency. However, if we push further we would be risking an even lower ROAS and higher CAC and in this case, we would recommend holding steady with spend today or finding a middle ground.  
  
We also don't recommend maintaining elevated budgets after the initial sales phase ends as we expect efficiency to drop dramatically, but will hike back up again over next weekend. Let us know if you are aligned here - or prefer to push forward for topline growth in this time.  
Thanks!

**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPCs hovering in the normal range ~$3  
• Amazon's impression share rose quite significantly last week. This might be due to heavy investment on brand terms during the Mother's Day Sale but we're eager to hear your insights here  
• Dermstore's impression share stands at 15.21% (below than the max target of 20% we've given them) although it did increase slightly WoW  
**General non-brand insights**   
• CPC's have spiked quite a bit last week for non-brand / product terms, especially against the red light hat. We believe that this might be an impact due to heavy competition / investment during the Mother's Day Sale period.   
• We'll report back by next week on whether CPCs normalize but we think there might be a few weeks of high CPCs due to the sale season this month (Mother's Day and Memorial Day)  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• We managed to improve impression share last week along with [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com) despite rising CPCs  
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• Our impression share has consistently been low in this space. We're aiming to share new ad copy for review by early next week in order to combat this  
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• We managed to increase our impression share last week which were slowly losing in previous weeks.

- **2025-05-08 15:11** *Rahul Vithanage* 💬 4 replies: Hi @Ingrid, we’ve connected with our Google reps, Tori and Casey, regarding a preliminary **Demand Gen (YouTube) investment plan.** While their initial recommendation was a $100K/month budget ($3,333/day) to drive statistically significant learnings, we flagged that as outside our scope and asked for a more realistic alternative.  
They’ve since shared the attached plan, which outlines a "crawl, walk, run" approach to budget scaling. While our original recommendation was $7,500/month ($250/day), the minimum viable spend in their framework—the “crawl” scenario—is set at **$15K/month ($500/day).** Given this is the **lowest tier that still ensures meaningful learnings,** we believe it makes sense to move forward at that level.  
In terms of **performance measurement,** Google suggested methods such as a **search lift study (only eligible at a $1000/day budget) and accounting for view-through conversions** among other things, which are outlined in the **“Holistic Measurement Framework”** section of their plan.  
One thing to call out: we may see a **dip in overall account efficiency** by launching this campaign at a $500/day budget or more. Since Demand Gen focuses on **upper-funnel objectives** like awareness and consideration, we **shouldn’t expect it to perform on the same metrics as Search, Shopping, or PMax.** For that reason, we recommend **reporting on Demand Gen performance separately**, as it will likely contribute to downstream conversions across other campaigns or organic channels.

- **2025-05-14 11:36** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through the weekly **search impression share insights** for **brand** and **non-brand (product) terms** :relaxed:  
  
**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPCs have increased. Corresponds to a rise in impression share by [dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com), [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) and [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com).  
• This could be a result of these **competitors investing heavily** across the board during their **Mother's Day promos**.  
• [dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com) **surpassed the maximum target impression share** we've provided them (20%) last week. Stood at 32%. We recommend **escalating this** to them right away.  
• Finally, [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) has been increasingly bidding on our branded terms and captured the **best impression share among all competitors** last week. We'll keep a close eye here.  
**General non-brand insights**  
• CPCs fell last week but still high.  
• As mentioned in last week's update, we're seeing **CPCs trending up starting from the week of 4/21** which corresponds to increased competition in the ad auction heading into MD.  
• We might notice **higher CPCs** towards the latter part of the month as well due to **increased competition during MDW**  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com)'s impression share rose significantly last week while [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) also managed to increase impression share slightly  
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• Impression share of market leaders like [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) are falling while new brands like [currentbody.ca](http://currentbody.ca), [schoolofdermatology.com](http://schoolofdermatology.com) and [omniluxled.com](http://omniluxled.com) have recently started gaining impression share.  
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• Over the last 2 weeks, we've managed to increase our impression share (which we were losing earlier to others). New copy should help us improve this further.

**Core Brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPC's have normalized last week as expected, being the week after Mother's Day week  
• **[dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com) still bidding high** on our **brand terms surpassing the max. impression share** we've provided them for the second week in a row. We should ideally escalate ASAP!   
• [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) still having a relatively high impression share  
**Sauna Blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• CPC's have dropped last week as expected, being the week after Mother's Day week. It fell below the general average of ~$3.6 - $4.  
• While we managed to improve our impression share over the last 2 weeks, so has [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com). So did [instyle.com](http://instyle.com) and [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) over last week.  
• We also launched new Sharma ad copy under this non-brand ad group on 5/15 and are hoping to see some good impression share results over the next few weeks.    
**Red Light Hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• CPC's have normalized last week as expected, being the week after Mother's Day week  
• Market leaders [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) managed to improve impression share quite a bit last week along with us.   
**PEMF Mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• CPCs have remained elevated last week, in contrast to other search ad groups, and are likely to stay high this week and the next due to MDW  
• We have lost impression share last week although we were gaining in the previous two weeks (probably due to high spending for MD sale). Competitors like [oxfordmedicals.com](http://oxfordmedicals.com), [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com), [magnawavepemf.com](http://magnawavepemf.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) have gained IS quite a bit last week. To address this, new ad copy will be prioritized for this ad group next week (after the MDW sale). Aiming to share for review by end of next week. cc: @User*7DB7H9 @User*PT7LCE

**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPC's interestingly fell well below average last week!   
• This might be due to several factors:  
    ◦ Competitors like [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) losing impression share  
    ◦ Our impression share improving to over 99%   
    ◦ Last week, despite scaling brand search (along with all other campaigns) for the MDW sale, our spending for core brand terms reduced while clicks increased. This means we drove very efficient brand clicks due to our promo last week.   
• [dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com) is still having an impression share that's higher than 20% for our brand terms (at 32.21%), although, it didn't have much of an impact on our costs last week due to points mentioned above. We'll evaluate their impression share and the impact on our CPCs next week and report back on where they stand and if they are still influencing our brand search costs.  
• Finally, we didn't notice other brands receiving an impression share against our brand terms last week despite running offers with certain retailers.  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• CPCs increased last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• Interestingly, competitor impression share dropped last week and our impression share grew, which was quite a positive trend to see!   
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• CPCs increased last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• Market leaders ([irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com)) as well as HD and [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com), were able to improve impression share last week.  
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• CPCs remained high last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• On a positive note, our impression share grew with scaling and we were able to beat out competitors that were catching up to us the week before last.   
• **New Sharma ad copy for PEMF** aimed at improving ad relevance / quality scores and impression share will be shared for review **this week.** [cc: @User_7DB7H9] This copy will help us maintain a good impression share vs. competitors going into an evergreen period while scaling down campaigns.

- **2025-06-04 14:25** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hi @Chris Jacob @Ingrid, here's a quick recap from today’s ***Google tag call:***  
• **Google Ads tracking** is confirmed to be working correctly via a test purchase.  
• For **GA4 tracking**, the rep said the current setup is fine, but asked us to check with your dev team / the team that set it up:  
    ◦ If they’re happy with the existing setup and recommend we continue with it. In this case, no further action is needed.  
    ◦ If they prefer / recommend switching to the new Shopify Google &amp; YouTube app setup. In this case, we can proceed—but we’ll need to **remove the current setup** to avoid duplicate conversions *afterwards*.  
Let me know what your team recommends. Also, it's important to not remove any set ups as of now, until we hear back from the team on the above.

- **2025-06-04 15:52** *Rahul Vithanage* 💬 4 replies: Hey @Ingrid, given the reduced paid media budget this month, we don’t currently have the capacity to test into Demand Gen/YouTube—though we’re definitely eager to explore it, as we believe it has strong potential!  
Right now, the entire Google budget is being used to support existing campaigns, so there’s no room to layer in YouTube within the current allocation.  
Google recommends a **$500/day** minimum for meaningful results (≈**$15K/month**), but if we want to stay budget-conscious, we could start with **$300/day** (≈**$9K/month**).  
Let us know if this incremental budget for YT is possible for June, or if you'd prefer we revisit it next month.  
Thanks! cc: @Ari Murray @Berkeley Clark
- **2025-06-05 09:58** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through the weekly **search impression share insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms :relaxed:  
  
**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• Our impression share dropped off a bit last week (Generally 95%+ but last week it came down to 85%+). This is a result of us scaling down significantly last week to maintain efficiency during the last few days of the sale.   
• No cause for concern here since over the L7D, impression share is once again up to a 97.23% as we returned to an evergreen state.   
• Also happy to report that over the last two weeks, CPCs have trended down vs. evergreen (generally around $3). This could be the impact of us pushing dermstore to reduce bids and budgets for our brand keywords. cc: @Chris Jacob   
**General non-brand insights**  
• CPCs are still high last week vs. evergreen. This was expected due to most MDW sales bleeding into last week (high ad auction competition during MD).   
• We're expecting CPCs to drop off from this week (6/2) as we return to a fully evergreen state.  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• Over the last 4 weeks, [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com) seems to have improved their impression share which could be an indicator that they are bidding more into / scaling into sauna blanket terms, especially during sale periods.   
• Nevertheless, we're still the market leader and we expect to stay at this level as we return to an evergreen state while also having launched new ad copy which seems to be performing better vs. older copy.   
• We'll also ensure to scale if required to maintain our position as the market leader.   
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) still remain market leaders while [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com) also managed to improve their impression share last week, most likely due to high spending during Memorial Day.  
• We're planning on working on new ad copy under this ad group, which should allow us to improve our impression share and catch up to the market leaders during an evergreen state.   
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• We remain as market leaders in the space and are aiming to get copy launched soon (once approved) in order to improve our impression share further over the next few weeks.

- **2025-06-13 07:46** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing this week’s Google Search impression share and CPC update for brand and non-brand (product) terms :blush:  
  
**Core Brand (screenshot 1)**  
• We bounced back from the slight dip in impression share seen during the tail end of the MDW sale, now sitting strong at **97.86%** once again last week (up from 86.19% previous week).  
• What’s even better -- **CPCs dropped further** to **$1.43**, the lowest in over 2 months. This downward CPC trend started in the week of 5/19 and may still be influenced by reduced competition from Dermstore on branded terms. cc: @Chris Jacob  
**Sauna Blanket Non-Brand (screenshot 2)**  
• Our **impression share improved slightly to 38.78%** last week (from 35.08% the previous week), while **CPCs dropped from $5.07 to $3.82**—a positive shift post-sale, as expected, as we head into evergreen.  
• [Hydragun.com](http://Hydragun.com) remains aggressive, still above 30% IS, but we’re continuing to lead. New Sharma copy may be helping us stay in the lead here.  
**Red Light Hat Non-Brand (screenshot 3)**  
• Impression share dipped to **15.53%** last week (vs. 19.04% the previous week), likely from the effects of returning to an evergreen state *with reduced budgets* in June.  
• **CPCs came down slightly** from $7.71 to **$6.90**, which is a step in the right direction post-sale but we expect it to reduce further / normalize over the next few weeks during evergreen.   
**PEMF Mat Non-Brand (screenshot 4)**  
• Holding relatively steady with a **22.10% impression share**, just a minor drop from last week.  
• **CPCs also dropped** to **$5.01**, down from $5.82 post sale, as expected. We expect this to reduce further / normalize over the next few weeks during evergreen.   
• Thanks for approving the new PEMF search copy. Once this is launched, we expect to improve IS and improve our lead against competitors.

**Tiktok Performance L7 (6/16-6/22)**  
1DC Northbeam  
$6,760 (NC)  
ROAS: 0.18 (+251% WoW)  
Revenue: $1,220 (+250% WoW)  
CAC: $2,250 (-66.73% WoW)  
  
Updates and next steps  
• The low AOV product funnel is fully built out and has been spending since Friday  
    ◦ NB shows a .11 roas overall with a .21 roas in the retargeting ad group. This has started off slowly and we’re making adjustments this week. If we do not see significant improvement by the end of the week we’ll look to end this test   
• Our next test is to focus heavily on the high aov products as opposed to the low aov ones and segment these out closely  
• We are preparing to move body sculpt to a conversion focused campaign in July as well. The traffic campaign has been excellent so far with a .22 CPC and a CTR of 2.62.

For these columns, conversions are attributed in a similar way to how paid social platforms like Meta attributes conversions, which gives a better picture on the true performance/impact of a Demand Gen campaigns.

- **2025-06-28 05:29** *Rahul Vithanage* 💬 2 replies: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, apologies for the delay here. Sharing through our weekly **search impression share insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms.  
  
**Core Brand - Screenshot 1**  
• Impression share dropped to 91.91% in week 6/9. Correlates to scaling down post Father's Day sale on Jun 10.   
• Rose to **94.40% last week** most likely as a response to scaling back up based on Google rep recommendations   
• Staying strong above 90% for 7 of the past 8 weeks.  
• CPCs remain very efficient at **$1.68**, down significantly from early May highs. It has been under $2 since week 5/19 -- correlates to when dermstore confirmed they've been bidding less on our brand terms.   
• Key competitors (**Dermstore**, **Hydragun**) have pulled back / lost impression share over the last couple of weeks.  
• Amazon however increased their impression share over the last 2 weeks  
• Brand terms are well-defended with low CPCs, high impression share :white*check*mark:  
**Sauna Blanket (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 2**  
• Impression share rose to **33.41% last week**, recovering slightly from previous week’s dip -- most likely due to scaling down in week 6/9 and scaling back up in week 6/16.  
• CPCs dropped to **$4.66 last week**, down from $5.38 (Father's Day Sale week, 5/9) — a good sign of improving efficiency during an evergreen state although it hasn't reached true evergreen levels yet.  
• **Hydragun** remains our main competitor but is also trending down. **Amazon** managed to gain impression share over the last two weeks.  
• We have a decent lead, but still below May peak. This is most likely as we've scaled down dramatically in June.   
**Red Light Hat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 3**  
• **iRestore** and **Kiierr** continue to dominate the space.  
• Our share edged up to **11.41% last week**, but still far below the **31%** peak in week 5/9, likely due to scaling down significantly in June.  
• CPCs improved to **$6.08 last week**, down from over $10 in week 4/28. Slowly stabilizing post sales although it hasn't reached true evergreen levels yet.   
• **New Red Light Hat search copy** was launched this week and we expect to see an improvement in our share over the next few weeks.   
**PEMF Mat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 4**  
• Slight rise in share to **21.43% last week**, but still below earlier highs. Competitors, **Magnawavepemf** and **Healthnews** gaining ground. Likely due to scaling down significantly in June.  
• **New PEMF search copy** launched this week and we expect to see an improvement in our share over the next few weeks. We should also ideally think of scaling here to recapture impression share.   
• CPCs stable at **$5.05**, within recent averages. \n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.18.16 PM.png** (png, 418.2KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093F0GP329/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.18.16_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.18.51 PM.png** (png, 505.5KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093WFE289X/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.18.51_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.19.14 PM.png** (png, 550.7KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093F0H9W2Z/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.19.14_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.19.34 PM.png** (png, 524.0KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093BF2SGQN/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.19.34_pm.png)

- **2025-07-09 09:09** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through our **search impression share and CPC insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms.  
  
**Core Brand - Screenshot 1**  
• Defending brand terms very well with an impression share consistently over 90%, over the last 8+ weeks.  
• [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) have increased impression share over the last 4 weeks, indicating higher bidding on our brand terms.   
**Sauna Blanket (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 2**  
• Defending market share well - still the market leader. [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) is our main competitor in the space.   
• CPCs seem to be normalizing over the last 3 weeks, showcasing a slow return to an evergreen state  
**Red Light Hat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 3**  
• Market leaders [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) have seen a significant drop in impression share over the last 2 weeks. Possibly due to scaling down drastically post promos. Showcases a need to scale significantly during sale periods to remain competitive with them.  
• Competitors like [schoolofdermatology.com](http://schoolofdermatology.com) and [omniluxled.com](http://omniluxled.com) have managed to improve their share in the space and a new competitor has entered the auction house ([hoogahealth.com](http://hoogahealth.com))   
• We want to scale this campaign by 20% this week to assess if we can capture some additional impression share, traffic and conversions.   
**PEMF Mat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 4**  
• We remain market leaders in the space despite scaling down drastically in June. This indicates strong performance during evergreen periods. We also recently launched new ad copy under the PEMF ad group aimed at improving quality scores and impression share which seems to be working well in defending our share.   
• [magnawavepemf.com](http://magnawavepemf.com) remains our biggest competitor in the space.   
• CPCs are dropping / stabilizing, indicating a slow return to an evergreen state.

- **2025-07-10 09:20** *Rahul Vithanage* 💬 5 replies: Hey @Ingrid (cc: @Jourdan), we met with our Google rep Tori yesterday and here’s what we aligned on—sharing for visibility:  
• We’ll let the **Pmax scaling test** run for 30 days (from June 19 until July 18), then scale down any campaigns that aren’t driving incremental revenue post scale.  
 • On July 12 (after Prime Day), we’ll **increase the target ROAS** on one Pmax campaign by +15% and monitor for around 2 weeks before deciding whether to roll this out to other campaigns.  
 • **Demand Gen scaling to $500/day** will realistically need about 6 weeks for proper learning according to Tori. Let us know if you guys are down to up the budget to $500/day from the current $300/day.  
 • Waiting on Tori to confirm what the **ToF YT Reach/Traffic investment** will look like.

- **2025-07-10 10:58** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Jourdan and team, our Shopping campaign has had a bit of drop off in spends and revenue recently, so I did a little digging and noticed that *bundles* were the primary cause. I believe the bundle images which are synced to GMC showcases the evergreen offer, and because of this, GMC has disapproved those SKUs as promotional imagery is not allowed in Google Shopping placements. Would you guys be able to provide <mailto:rahul@sharmabrands.com|rahul@sharmabrands.com> and <mailto:berkeley@sharmabrands.com|berkeley@sharmabrands.com> admin access to your GMC, and also provide us alternate image links for each bundle that's live on-site, which doesn't showcase the offer?  
Thanks in advance!

I've managed to get most of our bundles approved on GMC, which were previously flagged as having promotional imagery and were disapproved. The fix of adding a supplemental feed with the new image links (without the promo stickers) worked :relaxed:  
  
The Sauna Blanket Starter Kit is still disapproved but I have requested a review from GMC. Will keep an eye here and let you guys know once it's approved too.  
  
I also noticed that the Summer Travel Glow Kit is missing on GMC. I can work on getting it added although I might need some clarity as to who manages the current product feeds on GMC. I've attached a screenshot of the feeds (data sources) connected to GMC. Once I know who currently manages them, I can work closely with them to get the new bundle added and make any further optis.

- **2025-07-18 12:07** *Rahul Vithanage* 💬 11 replies: Hey @Jourdan @Ingrid – sharing a quick update on the ***PMax scaling test***, since today marks the end of the 30-day test window (June 19 to July 17).  
  
*Overall, scaling results look promising.*  
**Here’s a breakdown based on *Northbeam 1DC data* (Jun 19–Jul 17 vs. previous period):**  
• *Non-Brand PEMF PMax* up 131% in revenue | 1.68 ROAS (+20%) | *NB 1DC*  
• *Non-Brand Sauna Blanket PMax* up 40% in revenue | 1.60 ROAS (-33%) | *NB 1DC*  
• *Non-Brand Red Light PMax* up 43% in revenue | 1.58 ROAS (+1%) | *NB 1DC*  
Note: The previous period included the *Body Sculptor launch and Father’s Day sale*, so we’re comparing against an inflated baseline.  
  
**From *Google in-platform data for Pmax* (Jun 19–Jul 10 vs. previous period):**  
• Impressions up 19%  
• Clicks up +35%  
• CTR up +14%  
• CPV down -14%  
• Revenue down -41% (likely due to the stronger comparison period)  
The drop in CPV supports what Google mentioned about PMax leaning more into *Top-of-Funnel placements like YouTube*, which helps build awareness efficiently.  
  
***Recommendation:***  
Let’s maintain current PMax budget levels, given the incremental revenue in 3 of the 5 scaled campaigns and clear improvements in traffic quality.  
  
***Budget note*** cc: @Jourdan @Ingrid:  
We’re currently pacing about **$30K over the $100K Google budget** for July. This was expected, as we committed to running the **30-day PMax scaling test** through its full cycle.  
We’ve noticed that the **influencer platform is under-pacing** against July budgets. Let us know if we can reallocate from there to help absorb the Google overage.  
If you’d like us to **scale further into top-performing PMax campaigns**, we’re happy to — but we’d need an **additional ~$2,800** for the rest of the month to do so.  
Let us know how you'd like us to move forward.  
Thanks! cc: @Berkeley Clark @Jake Panzer @Ari Murray
- **2025-07-18 13:29** *Jourdan*: Hey @Rahul Vithanage thank you for the update and all the context that’s super helpful.  
  
We’re still down 9% YoY and since Google is the primary channel we don’t want to pull back if anything I want to keep pushing budgets on Google since we’re down 23% in spend Last 7.  
  
Do you have insights into why budget is pulling back?  
  
  
CC: @Jake Panzer I also see some under performing campaigns on Meta like PEMF and Sauna Blanket that we could reduce spend on, shift budget to other performing campaigns, or shift the budget to google.  
  
I’d love to know both of your thoughts so we can keep pushing revenue up.  
  
I know we’re up against a few challenges compared to last year but we’re not too far behind on rev.\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*

Since the current product feeds are set up through B&T's feedonomics enterprise account, can we have them take a look and pass the updated PDP URLs to GMC? Alternatively, we can set up a supplemental feed with the updated URLs from our end. Let us know how you want to move forward.  
cc: @Jourdan @Ingrid @Ari Murray @Berkeley Clark
- **2025-07-24 09:00** *Rahul Vithanage*: Roger that! @Jourdan I think first order of business is switching the bidding strategy to **"Maximize Conversion Value"** and allowing the campaigns to spend their full budget (~$540/day) and collect 50+ conversions in a 30 day period. During this time, we will definitely see lower efficiency but higher spending and conversions. After the campaigns collect sufficient data in a 30 day period (50+), we can switch to the **"Target ROAS"** bidding strategy to drive efficiency while focusing on maximizing revenue. Let me know if I have the green light to go ahead with the change.

**Core Brand - Screenshot 1**  
• Defending brand terms very well with an impression share of over 90%, consistently, for the past 7 weeks  
• CPCs are at an all time low - great news!  
• [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) 's share dropped over the last week. Amazon's drop might be related to the end of the offer there.   
**Sauna Blanket (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 2**  
• We're still the market leader. The gap between our share and competitors' share has widened, indicating strong evergreen performance  
**Red Light Hat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 3**  
• [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) have, once again, managed to become market leaders  
• Our impression share has been a little low consistently as we're dealing with severe competition (possibly with high budgets, bids and lower TROAS).   
• Reduced the Target ROAS Red Light Hat ad group by 20% to try to gain better market share  
• CPCs are reducing which is a solid sign and showcases return to evergreen periods  
**PEMF Mat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 4**  
• Have lost some market share to competitors, possibly due to higher budgets, bids and lower TROAS  
• Added dynamic keyword insertion in all ads under the PEMF ad group for better quality scores (relevance), hoping to win back impression share  
• Reduced the target ROAS of the PEMF ad group by 20% to try to win back market share  
• CPCs are reducing which is a solid sign and showcases return to evergreen periods

I’m especially interested in what more we can do on the retention side. In other brands’ Klaviyo accounts I’m seeing a higher cadence—sometimes daily sends—but obviously that only works when it’s done thoughtfully and doesn’t fatigue the list or hurt deliverability.  
  
Could we  
1. Work towards daily campaign sends?   
2. Brainstorm audience segments we could touch that we haven’t already?  
3. Discuss list-growth opportunities so we can support increased sends ongoing?  
I’m happy to setup a quick sync and pull any data/insights ahead of time. Let me know what would be most helpful! Excited to collaborate and keep the momentum goin

The wholesale is lumpy because we don't get clean sell through data for everyone so a lot of data is based on when we large/bulk ship a PO  
In that regard I would look more at rolling 12 month columns than each individual month  
  
This is broken by underlying product (so a bundle is counted as one unit each of the component parts)\n\n📎 **Sell Through_March 2025.xlsx** (xlsx, 176.0KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F08LELCJVTL/sell_through_march_2025.xlsx)

- **2025-04-10 11:58** *Chris Jacob*: <!channel> i took a prescheduled call with Northbeam reps  
• They are available to Sharma for whatever if rollover help is needed  
• They are still failing to correctly clear out $0 order (we use for marketing comps and warranty replacements)  
• This affects anything in NB that relies on order count like AOV
- **2025-04-10 12:02** *Berkeley Clark* 💬 3 replies: @Chris Jacob We would love to attend that call and help move things along! We can also shoot through an urgent message right now to reps on our side to see if we can get the $0 orders resolved more quickly.
- **2025-04-10 15:40** *Chris Jacob*: <!channel> related to call just now it would be helpful to see if any info (even if imperfect) we have to date - few months of Northbeam, Motion, whatever - can inform any sense of the relative costs of converting into a sale of different products  
  
I have little notion of this and I think it can help inform a lot because, as examples  
• Blanket and Go Mat are same priced products - but very different maturity, ability for customer to understand, etc - what's our relative cost to convert?  
• A Pro Mat drops 3.2x a mask to the bottom line - I doubt it costs 3x spend to convert but even if it does the contribution margin gap is enormous

• Strong week in performance with ROAS and CAC both improving heavily in the account which resulted in a 14% revenue increase.  
• The main contributor in terms of revenue gained in the account was the Red Light Products ASC and the following ad drove home nearly 50% of attributed revenue for the campaign.  
    ◦ ***Ad**: MULT | VID | 16-20s VID | Lifestyle | Light | Red Light Hat | 040125 | Hat on the Go | PDP*  
• In terms of ROAS, the volume DABA campaign lead the way with a 8.24x ROAS.  
• This is a trend we are seeing in the Meta accounts recently where catalog ads are performing at a very high efficiency level compared to normal ad sets. With this in mind, we are looking at scaling where possible to keep up with the momentum.  
• Net new actions taken this week was the launch of the TOF Sauna Blanket creative testing campaign. Along with the Oprah ads, we are launching the first set of SB ads into this campaign today.  
• Along with this, we are also going to be launching the Red Light TOF creative testing campaign today too, heading into the weekend.  
[Best Performing Creative](https://projects.motionapp.com/snapshot/67f944b0c76352823f443bd1)  
• The DPA’s continued to have strong performance and the top 8 ads that spent over $750 L7 had a good mix of statics and videos.

Summary of optis:  
• Updated campaign objectives to "Sales" across Brand and Non-Brand Search to better align with performance goals.  
• Switched bidding strategies of two Brand Search campaigns to automated bidding across to drive scale.  
• Paused the underperforming Brand Sale ad group (0 revenue L60D) under US*Brand*Core campaign  
• Scaled budgets across top-performing campaigns to capture incremental revenue:  
    ◦ +10% on PMax Brand All Products &amp; PMax Non-Brand Sauna Blanket  
    ◦ +20% on PMax Brand Consumables &amp; PMax Non-Brand PEMF  
    ◦ +20% on Non-Brand Products Search  
• Reduced budget on PMax Non-Brand Red Light by 20% due to underperformance  
• Scaled down the three main Brand Search campaigns by 20% to assess top-line revenue impact.  
• Optimized all non-brand campaigns to bid exclusively on new customers (vs. just bidding higher).  
• Excluded brand terms from non-brand search campaigns.  
• Further scaled down US*PMax*NonBrand*RedLight by 20% — previous Apr 4 scale-down drove ROAS improvement without impacting revenue.  
• Paused poor-performing keywords in US*NonBrand*Concern that spent significantly without generating meaningful revenue over the last 60 days.  
• Paused low-performing ad in NonBrand*Concern*RedLightMask ad group to prioritize top-performing creative.

Actions taken and points for next week  
• Turned off underperformers in original SPC. Leaving only the top performers there to get everything we can out of them  
• Duped the SPC and kept only the creatives that had not gotten any spend to test if any of those are winners  
• Checked for usage rights and turned off the expired one  
• Working with Chandler and Blake to kickoff shop on the right foot. Would love to get something on the calendar with them for intros and learning  
• Start building true campaign structure as we get creative in

- **2025-04-16 10:50** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Ingrid, apologies for the delay in sending this through but here's the **non-brand search impression share by product** along w/ some insights to consider.  
  
**Screenshot 1 -  Sauna Blanket**  
• CPCs hovering around $3 - $4  
• Our impression share is the best in the space and is around 30% on average  
• With new ad copy coming in, designed to improve strength and keyword-relevance, we're hoping to see impression share grow further.   
**Screenshot 2 -  Red Light Hat**  
• CPCs hovering around $4.5 - $8. Slightly volatile. More competitors in the space  
• There was a hike in CPCs during the week of Mar 3 - Mar 24. The green competitor ([illumiflow.com](http://illumiflow.com)) seems to have had an impact there.   
• More importantly, the red competitor ([irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com)) has had higher impression share in the red light hat space consistently, so we'll be taking a few pointers from them for our new hat search ad copy.   
**Screenshot 3 -  PEMF**   
• CPCs hovering around a $3.70- $4.40. Seeing a rise from week of Mar 24 - Apr 7.  
• We're slowly starting to loose impression share while Amazon is slowly gaining.   
• For our new PEMF search ad copy, we'll be sure to take some pointers from amazon.   
Let me know if you have any thoughts / insights I might've missed. Thank you!

- **2025-04-18 12:36** *User_TS27JN*: Hey @Ingrid happy Friday! Two quick questions for you. Performance has been good on the platform and in order to test creatives fully and continue growth we'd like to increase our daily budget. We have kept where it was before taking over, but would love to have the go ahead for another $350 in daily spend (we are currently around $825 daily). That would add $4200 to the tiktok monthly budget for april. Second, I know we spoke about making sure the copy matches the creatives yesterday. While using this current campaign type tiktok assigns the copy and given its performance we would like to avoid shutting it down. With your permission we'd like to leave this one live and have our team whip up some more evergreen copy for the future! Thank you and have a great weekend CC @Berkeley Clark\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-04-18 at 1.18.59 PM.png** (png, 742.1KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F08NXA52J4U/screenshot_2025-04-18_at_1.18.59___pm.png)

- **2025-04-29 10:21** *User_TS27JN*: Hi @Ingrid and team here are Tiktok updates for the week. We did a look back of MoM as opposed to YoY due to the low spend in 2024.  
High level updates:  
• Chris is planning to upload category authorization documentation for shop. We will take over effectively completely from there in terms of set up and shop ad management. Affiliate split to come as we continue building the account and are in a stable place shop wise.   
Whats next:  
• Our plan is to test 2-3 creative ideas at a time at a high spend as opposed to spreading the account thin given high CAC high AOV.  This will help us be more intentional about learnings and hopefully speed up that process. While we do creative test the account will continue seeing performance fluctuation.   
    ◦ With that we are building a testing schedule for easy visibility/tracking (this will include various campaign types including manual, SPC, and search as well as the creative testing idea itself). We'll provide benchmarks for each test in this doc too.   
• We are slowly testing and phasing out the non sparked SPCs as creative fatigues, but definitely want to take advantage of some really great creative currently in the account while we can (heavy sauna blanket before it goes out of season completely).

Would it be possible to have a dedicated $750 daily budget towards the sale during this period (and next sale period!) and return back to the normal budget after?

- **2025-05-05 11:09** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hi @Ingrid, we wanted to share this with you directly before looping in the broader email thread with the Google reps. In short, we don't recommend scaling too much further in this time, given where we are at with efficiency. Often, we find reps try to push the limits of spend, so wanted to share the numbers below:  
  
• Last year (Apr 19–24, 2024), during the first six days of the Mother’s Day Sale, we spent $31,565.29 and generated $215,841.11 in revenue for a **ROAS of 6.84 and CPA of $92.53.**  
• This year (Apr 29–May 4, 2025), we spent $58,063.39 (+84% YoY) and drove $306,123.38 in revenue (+42% YoY), with a ROAS of 5.27 (-23% YoY) and a CPA of $110.72 (+20% YoY). These figures include late attribution.  
With scaling thus far, we've achieved incremental revenue at reduced efficiency. However, if we push further we would be risking an even lower ROAS and higher CAC and in this case, we would recommend holding steady with spend today or finding a middle ground.  
  
We also don't recommend maintaining elevated budgets after the initial sales phase ends as we expect efficiency to drop dramatically, but will hike back up again over next weekend. Let us know if you are aligned here - or prefer to push forward for topline growth in this time.  
Thanks!

**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPCs hovering in the normal range ~$3  
• Amazon's impression share rose quite significantly last week. This might be due to heavy investment on brand terms during the Mother's Day Sale but we're eager to hear your insights here  
• Dermstore's impression share stands at 15.21% (below than the max target of 20% we've given them) although it did increase slightly WoW  
**General non-brand insights**   
• CPC's have spiked quite a bit last week for non-brand / product terms, especially against the red light hat. We believe that this might be an impact due to heavy competition / investment during the Mother's Day Sale period.   
• We'll report back by next week on whether CPCs normalize but we think there might be a few weeks of high CPCs due to the sale season this month (Mother's Day and Memorial Day)  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• We managed to improve impression share last week along with [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com) despite rising CPCs  
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• Our impression share has consistently been low in this space. We're aiming to share new ad copy for review by early next week in order to combat this  
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• We managed to increase our impression share last week which were slowly losing in previous weeks.

- **2025-05-08 15:11** *Rahul Vithanage* 💬 4 replies: Hi @Ingrid, we’ve connected with our Google reps, Tori and Casey, regarding a preliminary **Demand Gen (YouTube) investment plan.** While their initial recommendation was a $100K/month budget ($3,333/day) to drive statistically significant learnings, we flagged that as outside our scope and asked for a more realistic alternative.  
They’ve since shared the attached plan, which outlines a "crawl, walk, run" approach to budget scaling. While our original recommendation was $7,500/month ($250/day), the minimum viable spend in their framework—the “crawl” scenario—is set at **$15K/month ($500/day).** Given this is the **lowest tier that still ensures meaningful learnings,** we believe it makes sense to move forward at that level.  
In terms of **performance measurement,** Google suggested methods such as a **search lift study (only eligible at a $1000/day budget) and accounting for view-through conversions** among other things, which are outlined in the **“Holistic Measurement Framework”** section of their plan.  
One thing to call out: we may see a **dip in overall account efficiency** by launching this campaign at a $500/day budget or more. Since Demand Gen focuses on **upper-funnel objectives** like awareness and consideration, we **shouldn’t expect it to perform on the same metrics as Search, Shopping, or PMax.** For that reason, we recommend **reporting on Demand Gen performance separately**, as it will likely contribute to downstream conversions across other campaigns or organic channels.

- **2025-05-14 11:36** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through the weekly **search impression share insights** for **brand** and **non-brand (product) terms** :relaxed:  
  
**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPCs have increased. Corresponds to a rise in impression share by [dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com), [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) and [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com).  
• This could be a result of these **competitors investing heavily** across the board during their **Mother's Day promos**.  
• [dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com) **surpassed the maximum target impression share** we've provided them (20%) last week. Stood at 32%. We recommend **escalating this** to them right away.  
• Finally, [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) has been increasingly bidding on our branded terms and captured the **best impression share among all competitors** last week. We'll keep a close eye here.  
**General non-brand insights**  
• CPCs fell last week but still high.  
• As mentioned in last week's update, we're seeing **CPCs trending up starting from the week of 4/21** which corresponds to increased competition in the ad auction heading into MD.  
• We might notice **higher CPCs** towards the latter part of the month as well due to **increased competition during MDW**  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com)'s impression share rose significantly last week while [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) also managed to increase impression share slightly  
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• Impression share of market leaders like [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) are falling while new brands like [currentbody.ca](http://currentbody.ca), [schoolofdermatology.com](http://schoolofdermatology.com) and [omniluxled.com](http://omniluxled.com) have recently started gaining impression share.  
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• Over the last 2 weeks, we've managed to increase our impression share (which we were losing earlier to others). New copy should help us improve this further.

**Core Brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPC's have normalized last week as expected, being the week after Mother's Day week  
• **[dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com) still bidding high** on our **brand terms surpassing the max. impression share** we've provided them for the second week in a row. We should ideally escalate ASAP!   
• [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) still having a relatively high impression share  
**Sauna Blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• CPC's have dropped last week as expected, being the week after Mother's Day week. It fell below the general average of ~$3.6 - $4.  
• While we managed to improve our impression share over the last 2 weeks, so has [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com). So did [instyle.com](http://instyle.com) and [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) over last week.  
• We also launched new Sharma ad copy under this non-brand ad group on 5/15 and are hoping to see some good impression share results over the next few weeks.    
**Red Light Hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• CPC's have normalized last week as expected, being the week after Mother's Day week  
• Market leaders [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) managed to improve impression share quite a bit last week along with us.   
**PEMF Mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• CPCs have remained elevated last week, in contrast to other search ad groups, and are likely to stay high this week and the next due to MDW  
• We have lost impression share last week although we were gaining in the previous two weeks (probably due to high spending for MD sale). Competitors like [oxfordmedicals.com](http://oxfordmedicals.com), [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com), [magnawavepemf.com](http://magnawavepemf.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) have gained IS quite a bit last week. To address this, new ad copy will be prioritized for this ad group next week (after the MDW sale). Aiming to share for review by end of next week. cc: @User*7DB7H9 @User*PT7LCE

**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPC's interestingly fell well below average last week!   
• This might be due to several factors:  
    ◦ Competitors like [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) losing impression share  
    ◦ Our impression share improving to over 99%   
    ◦ Last week, despite scaling brand search (along with all other campaigns) for the MDW sale, our spending for core brand terms reduced while clicks increased. This means we drove very efficient brand clicks due to our promo last week.   
• [dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com) is still having an impression share that's higher than 20% for our brand terms (at 32.21%), although, it didn't have much of an impact on our costs last week due to points mentioned above. We'll evaluate their impression share and the impact on our CPCs next week and report back on where they stand and if they are still influencing our brand search costs.  
• Finally, we didn't notice other brands receiving an impression share against our brand terms last week despite running offers with certain retailers.  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• CPCs increased last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• Interestingly, competitor impression share dropped last week and our impression share grew, which was quite a positive trend to see!   
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• CPCs increased last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• Market leaders ([irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com)) as well as HD and [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com), were able to improve impression share last week.  
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• CPCs remained high last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• On a positive note, our impression share grew with scaling and we were able to beat out competitors that were catching up to us the week before last.   
• **New Sharma ad copy for PEMF** aimed at improving ad relevance / quality scores and impression share will be shared for review **this week.** [cc: @User_7DB7H9] This copy will help us maintain a good impression share vs. competitors going into an evergreen period while scaling down campaigns.

- **2025-06-04 14:25** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hi @Chris Jacob @Ingrid, here's a quick recap from today’s ***Google tag call:***  
• **Google Ads tracking** is confirmed to be working correctly via a test purchase.  
• For **GA4 tracking**, the rep said the current setup is fine, but asked us to check with your dev team / the team that set it up:  
    ◦ If they’re happy with the existing setup and recommend we continue with it. In this case, no further action is needed.  
    ◦ If they prefer / recommend switching to the new Shopify Google &amp; YouTube app setup. In this case, we can proceed—but we’ll need to **remove the current setup** to avoid duplicate conversions *afterwards*.  
Let me know what your team recommends. Also, it's important to not remove any set ups as of now, until we hear back from the team on the above.

- **2025-06-04 15:52** *Rahul Vithanage* 💬 4 replies: Hey @Ingrid, given the reduced paid media budget this month, we don’t currently have the capacity to test into Demand Gen/YouTube—though we’re definitely eager to explore it, as we believe it has strong potential!  
Right now, the entire Google budget is being used to support existing campaigns, so there’s no room to layer in YouTube within the current allocation.  
Google recommends a **$500/day** minimum for meaningful results (≈**$15K/month**), but if we want to stay budget-conscious, we could start with **$300/day** (≈**$9K/month**).  
Let us know if this incremental budget for YT is possible for June, or if you'd prefer we revisit it next month.  
Thanks! cc: @Ari Murray @Berkeley Clark
- **2025-06-05 09:58** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through the weekly **search impression share insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms :relaxed:  
  
**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• Our impression share dropped off a bit last week (Generally 95%+ but last week it came down to 85%+). This is a result of us scaling down significantly last week to maintain efficiency during the last few days of the sale.   
• No cause for concern here since over the L7D, impression share is once again up to a 97.23% as we returned to an evergreen state.   
• Also happy to report that over the last two weeks, CPCs have trended down vs. evergreen (generally around $3). This could be the impact of us pushing dermstore to reduce bids and budgets for our brand keywords. cc: @Chris Jacob   
**General non-brand insights**  
• CPCs are still high last week vs. evergreen. This was expected due to most MDW sales bleeding into last week (high ad auction competition during MD).   
• We're expecting CPCs to drop off from this week (6/2) as we return to a fully evergreen state.  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• Over the last 4 weeks, [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com) seems to have improved their impression share which could be an indicator that they are bidding more into / scaling into sauna blanket terms, especially during sale periods.   
• Nevertheless, we're still the market leader and we expect to stay at this level as we return to an evergreen state while also having launched new ad copy which seems to be performing better vs. older copy.   
• We'll also ensure to scale if required to maintain our position as the market leader.   
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) still remain market leaders while [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com) also managed to improve their impression share last week, most likely due to high spending during Memorial Day.  
• We're planning on working on new ad copy under this ad group, which should allow us to improve our impression share and catch up to the market leaders during an evergreen state.

- **2025-06-13 07:46** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing this week’s Google Search impression share and CPC update for brand and non-brand (product) terms :blush:  
  
**Core Brand (screenshot 1)**  
• We bounced back from the slight dip in impression share seen during the tail end of the MDW sale, now sitting strong at **97.86%** once again last week (up from 86.19% previous week).  
• What’s even better -- **CPCs dropped further** to **$1.43**, the lowest in over 2 months. This downward CPC trend started in the week of 5/19 and may still be influenced by reduced competition from Dermstore on branded terms. cc: @Chris Jacob  
**Sauna Blanket Non-Brand (screenshot 2)**  
• Our **impression share improved slightly to 38.78%** last week (from 35.08% the previous week), while **CPCs dropped from $5.07 to $3.82**—a positive shift post-sale, as expected, as we head into evergreen.  
• [Hydragun.com](http://Hydragun.com) remains aggressive, still above 30% IS, but we’re continuing to lead. New Sharma copy may be helping us stay in the lead here.  
**Red Light Hat Non-Brand (screenshot 3)**  
• Impression share dipped to **15.53%** last week (vs. 19.04% the previous week), likely from the effects of returning to an evergreen state *with reduced budgets* in June.  
• **CPCs came down slightly** from $7.71 to **$6.90**, which is a step in the right direction post-sale but we expect it to reduce further / normalize over the next few weeks during evergreen.   
**PEMF Mat Non-Brand (screenshot 4)**  
• Holding relatively steady with a **22.10% impression share**, just a minor drop from last week.  
• **CPCs also dropped** to **$5.01**, down from $5.82 post sale, as expected. We expect this to reduce further / normalize over the next few weeks during evergreen.   
• Thanks for approving the new PEMF search copy. Once this is launched, we expect to improve IS and improve our lead against competitors.

**Tiktok Performance L7 (6/16-6/22)**  
1DC Northbeam  
$6,760 (NC)  
ROAS: 0.18 (+251% WoW)  
Revenue: $1,220 (+250% WoW)  
CAC: $2,250 (-66.73% WoW)  
  
Updates and next steps  
• The low AOV product funnel is fully built out and has been spending since Friday  
    ◦ NB shows a .11 roas overall with a .21 roas in the retargeting ad group. This has started off slowly and we’re making adjustments this week. If we do not see significant improvement by the end of the week we’ll look to end this test   
• Our next test is to focus heavily on the high aov products as opposed to the low aov ones and segment these out closely  
• We are preparing to move body sculpt to a conversion focused campaign in July as well. The traffic campaign has been excellent so far with a .22 CPC and a CTR of 2.62.

- **2025-06-24 10:24** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Jourdan, these are the **"platform comparable"** metrics I was referring to, which are available for Demand Gen campaigns *only*. For these columns, conversions are attributed in a similar way to how paid social platforms like Meta attributes conversions, which gives a better picture on the true performance/impact of a Demand Gen campaigns.

- **2025-06-28 05:29** *Rahul Vithanage* 💬 2 replies: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, apologies for the delay here. Sharing through our weekly **search impression share insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms.  
  
**Core Brand - Screenshot 1**  
• Impression share dropped to 91.91% in week 6/9. Correlates to scaling down post Father's Day sale on Jun 10.   
• Rose to **94.40% last week** most likely as a response to scaling back up based on Google rep recommendations   
• Staying strong above 90% for 7 of the past 8 weeks.  
• CPCs remain very efficient at **$1.68**, down significantly from early May highs. It has been under $2 since week 5/19 -- correlates to when dermstore confirmed they've been bidding less on our brand terms.   
• Key competitors (**Dermstore**, **Hydragun**) have pulled back / lost impression share over the last couple of weeks.  
• Amazon however increased their impression share over the last 2 weeks  
• Brand terms are well-defended with low CPCs, high impression share :white*check*mark:  
**Sauna Blanket (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 2**  
• Impression share rose to **33.41% last week**, recovering slightly from previous week’s dip -- most likely due to scaling down in week 6/9 and scaling back up in week 6/16.  
• CPCs dropped to **$4.66 last week**, down from $5.38 (Father's Day Sale week, 5/9) — a good sign of improving efficiency during an evergreen state although it hasn't reached true evergreen levels yet.  
• **Hydragun** remains our main competitor but is also trending down. **Amazon** managed to gain impression share over the last two weeks.  
• We have a decent lead, but still below May peak. This is most likely as we've scaled down dramatically in June.   
**Red Light Hat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 3**  
• **iRestore** and **Kiierr** continue to dominate the space.  
• Our share edged up to **11.41% last week**, but still far below the **31%** peak in week 5/9, likely due to scaling down significantly in June.  
• CPCs improved to **$6.08 last week**, down from over $10 in week 4/28. Slowly stabilizing post sales although it hasn't reached true evergreen levels yet.   
• **New Red Light Hat search copy** was launched this week and we expect to see an improvement in our share over the next few weeks.   
**PEMF Mat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 4**  
• Slight rise in share to **21.43% last week**, but still below earlier highs. Competitors, **Magnawavepemf** and **Healthnews** gaining ground. Likely due to scaling down significantly in June.  
• **New PEMF search copy** launched this week and we expect to see an improvement in our share over the next few weeks. We should also ideally think of scaling here to recapture impression share.   
• CPCs stable at **$5.05**, within recent averages. \n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.18.16 PM.png** (png, 418.2KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093F0GP329/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.18.16_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.18.51 PM.png** (png, 505.5KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093WFE289X/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.18.51_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.19.14 PM.png** (png, 550.7KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093F0H9W2Z/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.19.14_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.19.34 PM.png** (png, 524.0KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093BF2SGQN/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.19.34_pm.png)

- **2025-07-09 09:09** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through our **search impression share and CPC insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms.  
  
**Core Brand - Screenshot 1**  
• Defending brand terms very well with an impression share consistently over 90%, over the last 8+ weeks.  
• [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) have increased impression share over the last 4 weeks, indicating higher bidding on our brand terms.   
**Sauna Blanket (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 2**  
• Defending market share well - still the market leader. [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) is our main competitor in the space.   
• CPCs seem to be normalizing over the last 3 weeks, showcasing a slow return to an evergreen state  
**Red Light Hat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 3**  
• Market leaders [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) have seen a significant drop in impression share over the last 2 weeks. Possibly due to scaling down drastically post promos. Showcases a need to scale significantly during sale periods to remain competitive with them.  
• Competitors like [schoolofdermatology.com](http://schoolofdermatology.com) and [omniluxled.com](http://omniluxled.com) have managed to improve their share in the space and a new competitor has entered the auction house ([hoogahealth.com](http://hoogahealth.com))   
• We want to scale this campaign by 20% this week to assess if we can capture some additional impression share, traffic and conversions.   
**PEMF Mat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 4**  
• We remain market leaders in the space despite scaling down drastically in June. This indicates strong performance during evergreen periods. We also recently launched new ad copy under the PEMF ad group aimed at improving quality scores and impression share which seems to be working well in defending our share.   
• [magnawavepemf.com](http://magnawavepemf.com) remains our biggest competitor in the space.   
• CPCs are dropping / stabilizing, indicating a slow return to an evergreen state.

- **2025-07-10 09:20** *Rahul Vithanage* 💬 5 replies: Hey @Ingrid (cc: @Jourdan), we met with our Google rep Tori yesterday and here’s what we aligned on—sharing for visibility:  
• We’ll let the **Pmax scaling test** run for 30 days (from June 19 until July 18), then scale down any campaigns that aren’t driving incremental revenue post scale.  
 • On July 12 (after Prime Day), we’ll **increase the target ROAS** on one Pmax campaign by +15% and monitor for around 2 weeks before deciding whether to roll this out to other campaigns.  
 • **Demand Gen scaling to $500/day** will realistically need about 6 weeks for proper learning according to Tori. Let us know if you guys are down to up the budget to $500/day from the current $300/day.  
 • Waiting on Tori to confirm what the **ToF YT Reach/Traffic investment** will look like.

- **2025-07-10 10:58** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Jourdan and team, our Shopping campaign has had a bit of drop off in spends and revenue recently, so I did a little digging and noticed that *bundles* were the primary cause. I believe the bundle images which are synced to GMC showcases the evergreen offer, and because of this, GMC has disapproved those SKUs as promotional imagery is not allowed in Google Shopping placements. Would you guys be able to provide <mailto:rahul@sharmabrands.com|rahul@sharmabrands.com> and <mailto:berkeley@sharmabrands.com|berkeley@sharmabrands.com> admin access to your GMC, and also provide us alternate image links for each bundle that's live on-site, which doesn't showcase the offer?  
Thanks in advance!

I've managed to get most of our bundles approved on GMC, which were previously flagged as having promotional imagery and were disapproved. The fix of adding a supplemental feed with the new image links (without the promo stickers) worked :relaxed:  
  
The Sauna Blanket Starter Kit is still disapproved but I have requested a review from GMC. Will keep an eye here and let you guys know once it's approved too.  
  
I also noticed that the Summer Travel Glow Kit is missing on GMC. I can work on getting it added although I might need some clarity as to who manages the current product feeds on GMC. I've attached a screenshot of the feeds (data sources) connected to GMC. Once I know who currently manages them, I can work closely with them to get the new bundle added and make any further optis.

- **2025-07-18 12:07** *Rahul Vithanage* 💬 11 replies: Hey @Jourdan @Ingrid – sharing a quick update on the ***PMax scaling test***, since today marks the end of the 30-day test window (June 19 to July 17).  
  
*Overall, scaling results look promising.*  
**Here’s a breakdown based on *Northbeam 1DC data* (Jun 19–Jul 17 vs. previous period):**  
• *Non-Brand PEMF PMax* up 131% in revenue | 1.68 ROAS (+20%) | *NB 1DC*  
• *Non-Brand Sauna Blanket PMax* up 40% in revenue | 1.60 ROAS (-33%) | *NB 1DC*  
• *Non-Brand Red Light PMax* up 43% in revenue | 1.58 ROAS (+1%) | *NB 1DC*  
Note: The previous period included the *Body Sculptor launch and Father’s Day sale*, so we’re comparing against an inflated baseline.  
  
**From *Google in-platform data for Pmax* (Jun 19–Jul 10 vs. previous period):**  
• Impressions up 19%  
• Clicks up +35%  
• CTR up +14%  
• CPV down -14%  
• Revenue down -41% (likely due to the stronger comparison period)  
The drop in CPV supports what Google mentioned about PMax leaning more into *Top-of-Funnel placements like YouTube*, which helps build awareness efficiently.  
  
***Recommendation:***  
Let’s maintain current PMax budget levels, given the incremental revenue in 3 of the 5 scaled campaigns and clear improvements in traffic quality.  
  
***Budget note*** cc: @Jourdan @Ingrid:  
We’re currently pacing about **$30K over the $100K Google budget** for July. This was expected, as we committed to running the **30-day PMax scaling test** through its full cycle.  
We’ve noticed that the **influencer platform is under-pacing** against July budgets. Let us know if we can reallocate from there to help absorb the Google overage.  
If you’d like us to **scale further into top-performing PMax campaigns**, we’re happy to — but we’d need an **additional ~$2,800** for the rest of the month to do so.  
Let us know how you'd like us to move forward.  
Thanks! cc: @Berkeley Clark @Jake Panzer @Ari Murray
- **2025-07-18 13:29** *Jourdan*: Hey @Rahul Vithanage thank you for the update and all the context that’s super helpful.  
  
We’re still down 9% YoY and since Google is the primary channel we don’t want to pull back if anything I want to keep pushing budgets on Google since we’re down 23% in spend Last 7.  
  
Do you have insights into why budget is pulling back?  
  
  
CC: @Jake Panzer I also see some under performing campaigns on Meta like PEMF and Sauna Blanket that we could reduce spend on, shift budget to other performing campaigns, or shift the budget to google.  
  
I’d love to know both of your thoughts so we can keep pushing revenue up.  
  
I know we’re up against a few challenges compared to last year but we’re not too far behind on rev.\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*

Since the current product feeds are set up through B&T's feedonomics enterprise account, can we have them take a look and pass the updated PDP URLs to GMC? Alternatively, we can set up a supplemental feed with the updated URLs from our end. Let us know how you want to move forward.  
cc: @Jourdan @Ingrid @Ari Murray @Berkeley Clark
- **2025-07-24 09:00** *Rahul Vithanage*: Roger that! @Jourdan I think first order of business is switching the bidding strategy to **"Maximize Conversion Value"** and allowing the campaigns to spend their full budget (~$540/day) and collect 50+ conversions in a 30 day period. During this time, we will definitely see lower efficiency but higher spending and conversions. After the campaigns collect sufficient data in a 30 day period (50+), we can switch to the **"Target ROAS"** bidding strategy to drive efficiency while focusing on maximizing revenue. Let me know if I have the green light to go ahead with the change.

**Core Brand - Screenshot 1**  
• Defending brand terms very well with an impression share of over 90%, consistently, for the past 7 weeks  
• CPCs are at an all time low - great news!  
• [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) 's share dropped over the last week. Amazon's drop might be related to the end of the offer there.   
**Sauna Blanket (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 2**  
• We're still the market leader. The gap between our share and competitors' share has widened, indicating strong evergreen performance  
**Red Light Hat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 3**  
• [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) have, once again, managed to become market leaders  
• Our impression share has been a little low consistently as we're dealing with severe competition (possibly with high budgets, bids and lower TROAS).   
• Reduced the Target ROAS Red Light Hat ad group by 20% to try to gain better market share  
• CPCs are reducing which is a solid sign and showcases return to evergreen periods  
**PEMF Mat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 4**  
• Have lost some market share to competitors, possibly due to higher budgets, bids and lower TROAS  
• Added dynamic keyword insertion in all ads under the PEMF ad group for better quality scores (relevance), hoping to win back impression share  
• Reduced the target ROAS of the PEMF ad group by 20% to try to win back market share  
• CPCs are reducing which is a solid sign and showcases return to evergreen periods

I’m especially interested in what more we can do on the retention side. In other brands’ Klaviyo accounts I’m seeing a higher cadence—sometimes daily sends—but obviously that only works when it’s done thoughtfully and doesn’t fatigue the list or hurt deliverability.  
  
Could we  
1. Work towards daily campaign sends?   
2. Brainstorm audience segments we could touch that we haven’t already?  
3. Discuss list-growth opportunities so we can support increased sends ongoing?  
I’m happy to setup a quick sync and pull any data/insights ahead of time. Let me know what would be most helpful! Excited to collaborate and keep the momentum goin

    - **2025-08-01 07:33** *Rahul Vithanage*: ↳ I was actually referring to consolidating search campaigns Jourdan - one primary campaign for brand and another for non-brand vs. having multiple. This way we can combine budgets which are currently fragmented and enter the auction house more competitively with higher budgets.  
Regarding product performance, are you referring to a report that you created on Google?
