- **2025-04-15 12:29** *User_D8QGMP*: Hi @Elyse @Ingrid  
  
I’m reaching out with a bit of a bittersweet update — I’ll be leaving Sharma Brands as of Monday and moving on to a new chapter. I'm incredibly grateful to have learned so much about your company and to have started working with you on the revamp of your flows.  
  
The good news: you’re in amazing hands moving forward. I’m thrilled to introduce you to @User*2Z9G95, who will be taking over your account, working closely with @User*4PNMDE and has already been working on your audit behind the scenes. She’s an amazing email strategist, and I know you’re going to love working with her.  
  
The rest of the CRM and creative team — including our designers and copywriter — will remain the same, so you’re in excellent hands all around.  
  
We’re working closely behind the scenes to ensure a smooth and seamless transition, and I’ll be around to support during this handoff period as well.  
  
Thank you so much again — wishing you continued success, and I hope our paths cross again in the future.  
Best,  
Lisa Skaggs\n\n*Reactions: :heart-cinnamon: User_5S72LT, Elyse, User_CDDP51*

- **2025-04-18 11:24** *Elyse*: Hi @User_2Z9G95 happy Friday! We’re evaluating overall email performance YoY, and want to gain a better understanding of why email is the only channel thats down 40% YoY. Can you put together an analysis for us please? Ideally looking for opportunities for go forward growth, as well as analysis on the last year.
- **2025-04-18 11:25** *Elyse*: Also @User_2Z9G95 we should be meeting internally on Monday for May messaging, so will have some key content themes for you/for May email calendar by Tuesday.
- **2025-04-18 17:23** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse — thank you for letting us know! Absolutely. We'll put together some insights and a go-forward strategy for our call on Tuesday. A few clarifying questions:  
• Where are you finding these results? Given attribution differences across platforms, we want to better understand where you're pulling your numbers.   
• What's the exact timeframe you're looking at? Are you looking at year-to-date data? To clarify, you're seeing a 40% drop in performance from Jan - Apr 2025 compared to Jan - Apr 2024?   
As a side — we've built out the briefs for the [Welcome Flow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KwAEJZIfJ302SX-vD8Lp*RqwH24hTFey*5XqJP_zbqQ/edit?tab=t.0) and [Replenishment Flow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-iCIB6Cvc43jP1k-EAYnWvCXr4Ge0Jkl13ihjW1YnT8/edit?tab=t.0), which are ready for your review. This is a high-level summary of what we're briefing out to our copywriters, so if there's any specific call-outs or any specific narratives we should be sharing, please add comments directly into the document. Once drafted, we'll pass them back to you all for final review and then we'll brief them out to our designers.  
  
Next week, we'll dive into optimizations within your Site Abandonment, Cart Abandonment, and Browse Abandonment flows — which will then follow a similar process. [I've created this CRM Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1csFoxkpwWmYtRuRfOE1QssDtjqMcmRm3wYaUGhYDnrg/edit?gid=1474997958#gid=1474997958) that will keep track of everything we're working on: Flows, Campaigns, and SMS (including any tests we're running). Please feel free to reference this if you have any questions in regards to status updates (of course, you can always reach out, too!).  
  
We'll standby for the updated May messaging.  
  
Please let me know if you have any questions, thanks!\n\n📎 **HigherDOSE CRM | Welcome Flow Audit, V2** (gdoc, 155.4KB) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KwAEJZIfJ302SX-vD8Lp_RqwH24hTFey_5XqJP_zbqQ/edit?tab=t.0)\n📎 **HigherDose CRM Tracker** (gsheet, 0B) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1csFoxkpwWmYtRuRfOE1QssDtjqMcmRm3wYaUGhYDnrg/edit?gid=1474997958#gid=1474997958)\n\n*Reactions: :+1::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

Our copywriter is working through them now, but we wanted to see if there were any specific call-outs or specific narratives we should be sharing. If not, we'll send through the copy docs once they're ready!

Thank you!*  
  
We're also in the process of building out May's content calendar. I see that your other agency has content scheduled through April 30th — is that the last email they will have scheduled? Are there any campaign narratives in particular you're looking for us to support in May outside of the sale? We're still working through campaign idea recommendations, but here's a high-level schedule of what we're envisioning:\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-04-24 at 3.19.33 PM.png** (png, 135.8KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F08P60TGZV5/screenshot_2025-04-24_at_3.19.33_pm.png)

    ◦ Discount drops to 15% off for the weekend with code DOSEMAMA  
    ◦ Bundles will go back down to 20% off, no code necessary  
    ◦ Goal here is more around “self-gifting”, gift cards  
• Memorial Day weekend 5/22 - 5/26  
    ◦ 20% off sitewide, code tbd will circle back when I have it  
    ◦ 5/22 will be VIP early access, but this will likely mean access to email/sms subscribers only

- **2025-04-28 13:06** *Elyse*: @User_2Z9G95 feedback on welcome flow copy from Lauren on our end:  
  
• Phrases like “grueling 9–5” and “life admin” feel a little cliché and casual. HigherDOSE typically feels more aspirational and less whiny about life’s stressors.  
• Some copy feels a bit basic (“Life is tiring. It’s never-ending.“) HigherDOSE usually sounds smarter, more energized, and more magnetic.  
• It’s missing a bit of that “sexy science” vibe — the feeling that you’re unlocking ancient wisdom and cutting-edge tech, and being seduced into self-care.  
• Good that they’re describing how you’ll feel but it could paint the sensory experience more! (HigherDOSE often invites you into a “felt” transformation!

We went the route of stronger narrative storytelling coupled with education. It's a much longer, denser version, but we're happy to go this route if the team would like. If not, we can certainly condense, too. Our copywriter, Chandler, left a few questions in there if you would be able to provide some context that would be fantastic.

We had a great meeting internally, we didn’t get to cover everything so we’re meeting again early next week - also to revise our current ideas to fit more synergistically now seeing what other channels are doing. But sharing this deck and my current calendar draft - would loooooove your thoughts on May (not finished with June) - so I can add any notes/revisions in before next team meeting:

- **2025-04-30 17:39** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse! Thanks so much for passing this along. Apologies for the delay, I wanted to do a deeper dive to see what I could find. We have a few thoughts to share: It turns out this customer is actually based in the UK — so they haven't been receiving any of the promotional messaging, they've only received campaigns and flows. It does look like this customer received two flow emails (Site and Browse) on the same day. To prevent this from happening in the future, we can add more specific profile filters (i.e. if customer is in X flow, prevent them from entering Y flow).  In addition, we also recommend turning on smart sending for all campaigns to help prevent this overlap. With Klaviyo's smart sending feature on — it prevents someone from receiving multiple emails within a 16 hour period. Because this wasn't in place, they've received all flow and campaign communication, which is likely what prompted them to reach out. We can also certainly create a preference page should people choose to customize their exclusions — we don't typically recommend relying solely on this — but with a strategic campaign segmentation strategy we should be able to prevent this from happening in the future!  
  
The good news: Klaviyo's unsubscribe rate is only up 7% L7 days over the previous 7 days, so the send rate isn't having too large of an impact on the rest of our community. In regards to long-term strategy implications — best practice is between 2-3 campaign sends per week, 4 can be pushing it, unless strategically segmented. We can put together a stronger segmentation strategy based what people viewed, previously ordered, etc. This is the strategy we recommend implementing moving forward. In regards to the campaigns themselves, given the feedback we've heard to date from you all, we're recommending a quality over quantity approach, where we'll be able to dive deeper into the stories, narratives, and data. We'll, of course, want to A/B test more longer-form content against shorter-form content to find what resonates most with our community, but regardless, we're excited about implementing this new longer-form, educational approach.  
  
I hope that helps provide some context! If there's anything else I can help clarify or dive deeper into, please let me know.\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Elyse*

- **2025-05-07 13:59** *User_2Z9G95*: @Elyse — Did Lauren's blog post already go live? If so, can you share the link? Thank you!
- **2025-05-07 14:47** *User_2Z9G95*: @Elyse – Just sent you the preview. We just need the blog link that I can add to that button! Let me know if there's any thoughts/feedback (the last two paragraphs are new, so please review those!). Since this is still a text-based email, we have pretty limited control in terms of the background design, so we went with more of a beige/off-white background color to add some dimension.
- **2025-05-07 14:54** *Elyse*: bckground fine by me\n\n*Reactions: :+1: User_2Z9G95*
- **2025-05-07 14:57** *Elyse*: one note - we say “might resonate” twice so thinking for bottom blurb:  
  
Even though I’m better able to prioritize self-care now, getting to this point wasn’t easy. I ignored so many warning signs until my body physically forced me to stop with a grand mal seizure. If you’re curious about my journey through motherhood, you can read my full blog post below.  
  
Happy Mother’s Day–to every woman discovering that choosing herself is not selfish, but one of the most powerful ways she can show up for the people she loves.

• 5/11 email is pending - working on an updated version - since this won't be a plain text, we can customize the name - would you like us to say "Hi HigherDOSE Family", "Hi Friend", "Hi There", or just leave the "Hi [name]" off?

As next steps, we'll:  
• Look at top-performing evergreen campaigns from last year (+ continue building out the campaign calendar)  
• Provide a weekly reporting summary to keep track of YoY performance  
• Keep flows moving ASAP\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse, :raised_hands: Ingrid*
- **2025-05-13 18:04** *User_2Z9G95*: @Elyse — Just an FYI, outside of the promos, the following were the top revenue-driving campaigns from mid-May to mid-June last year — no surprise, most are red light hat related, so I think a takeaway here is to replicate some (or all) of these stories post MBS launch:  
• Infrared saunas vs. traditional saunas  
• Red light hat before and after (this would be good pre-Father's Day)  
• Red light hat customer feature (also good pre-Father's Day)  
• Red light FAQs  
• Frequency matters - Frequency FAQ\n\n*Reactions: :+1::skin-tone-3: Elyse*
- **2025-05-14 11:47** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse — Looking forward to our copy chat this afternoon! If the team is able to share (either live on the call or after) examples that really nail down the tone of voice that would be helpful. Having a visual/seeing the examples IRL makes it much easier for us to understand. If there's any old email examples, pages on your site, or blog posts we can dissect together that would be fabulous.\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse, :eyes: Elyse*
- **2025-05-14 11:50** *User_2Z9G95*: Plus — if there's any email inspo you've shared recently that she's really loved — we can dive deeper into that, too!

- **2025-05-14 12:55** *Ingrid*: we should make sure they have access to our email inspo folder

I think potentially a launch on paid of 5/22 was mentioned, but our formal recco is to move forward with 5/21 as a lot of the market is already on sale and the longer period will benefit the ad learnings! cc @User*D39C0Z @User_2Z9G95\n\n📎 **HigherDOSE MDW Plan** (gdoc, 0B) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HIM62VuEVzgaNKz0FClHa3v0Ckvmcg-4JlDRVh_MX00/edit?tab=t.0)\n\n*Reactions: :pray: User_D39C0Z*

When we switch to full launch, we'll just swap out the early access messaging in the subject line for email 1 and the early access messaging in the SMS copy.

- **2025-05-19 18:04** *User_2Z9G95*: @Elyse — Here's our broad segmentation strategy for review! Last year, each email that was sent to the same broad engaged segment reached about 150,000 people, so this year we're broadening it to closer to 290,000. You'll see we have a mix of engaged, unengaged, and lapsed customers:  
  
**Engaged:**  
• 365 days engaged (broadening to people who engaged all year — they're likely waiting for this sale period!)  
• Purchasers (All Time)  
• 180 days engaged, never purchased (Targeted + Broad - difference here depends on how many emails they've received from us; targeted means they received more emails, so they're slightly more engaged)  
• Clicked/opened at least once in the last 365 days, never bought  
**Unengaged:**  
• 180 days unengaged (don't want this to be too broad (365), so we can ensure we're reaching people who haven't engaged without sacrificing engagement too much)  
• Never purchased   
• Never engaged, subscribed 60+ days ago  
**Lapsed:**  
• VIPs - Purchased more than once, but not in the last 60 days  
• Was engaged 30-60 days ago, but not recently (have purchased at somepoint)  
• Purchased once at least 60 days ago, but hasn't opened or clicked in the last 90  
I'll be able to follow up with the re-send segmentation strategy tomorrow once we get some data, but it will likely be those who didn't open and/or didn't click + didn't purchase.  
  
We'll monitor performance and if we need to remove some of the broad unengaged segments, we certainly can! Will keep you posted.  
  
***Question: Any other exclusions we should be aware of? Is the Red Light Hat available abroad? I looked at the sheet you initially shared, but the row isn't filled out. I think that's the only product that's getting a spotlight.*** \n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-05-19 at 2.41.40 PM.png** (png, 176.1KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F08T56Q129G/screenshot_2025-05-19_at_2.41.40___pm.png)

- **2025-05-21 13:07** *User_2Z9G95*: Update for the team: Based on initial insights, we're proposing an SMS send at 3p ET this afternoon. We have an SMS scheduled for everyday except today, so we'll bump up the bundle SMS to today and get another one drafted in its place (see attached).  
  
Additionally — the site, browse, and cart abandonment flows we copied each have one campaign, however, to further target these high-intent purchasers, we're recommending adding an additional campaign to be sent 25 hours after the first initial send. We've gone ahead and copied existing flows to create these campaigns and @Elyse — I would love to send those through for review ASAP so we can get them live!  
  
Let me know if there's any thoughts/feedback on the above. Thank you all!\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-05-21 at 11.05.22 AM.png** (png, 104.8KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F08T6CH1JP5/screenshot_2025-05-21_at_11.05.22___am.png)\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Elyse*

• Can we get them added to our master list, and send them the welcome flow but with a special code in it and some copy around like “great to meet you at the Ject Miami event. Welcome to the higherdose community” etc something along those lines. here’s a code to use for a week

- **2025-05-23 15:10** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse! CC: @Ingrid Letting you know everything for this weekend is scheduled and updated [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1csFoxkpwWmYtRuRfOE1QssDtjqMcmRm3wYaUGhYDnrg/edit?pli=1&gid=1474997958#gid=1474997958). We made a few tweaks to this weekend's segments. Since these emails are more product-focused and narrative in messaging, we tweaked the segments to be more engaged-driven. We removed any unengaged segments from this (which will ideally help drive click and open rate back up). We also included engaged, product-focused segments, focusing on those with higher-intent — see below:  
  
• Red Light Hat Spotlight: Added: Engaged L180, but never purchased Red Light Hat  
• PEMF Spotlight: Added: Engaged L180, but never purchased anything from the PEMF collection  
• Father's Day Gifting: Added: Engaged L180, but never purchased anything from the PEMF or Red Light collection  
I've included the full segment breakdown in the sheet if you want to see the others! Let us know if you have any thoughts, but we think targeting engaged segments for the weekend sends will put us in a great place engagement and conversion wise come Monday and Tuesday, when we're ready to double down on last minute/extended sale messaging to our initial broad audience.\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

Apologies for the weekend ping, but since we've seen such strong performance on SMS, we're recommending a third later evening re-send to capture any last-minute, high-intent shoppers (excluding purchasers, of course). Please see the SMS below and I'm happy to pass along a preview for you to review when you get the chance. If all looks good, we'll schedule for 8p ET.

Is there a way to extend this until 9am ET or 10a ET tomorrow morning, so that I can manually update everything first thing in the AM? Let me know if this would be possible!

I can ask Cory if they have any other brands that have seen success with that for inspo, but we'd likely include the evergreen 10% off with the coming soon messaging.
- **2025-05-27 15:51** *Elyse*: let me check with ingrid on that when shes back in office tomorrow. think we’d be okay with it as we’re starting social teasers earlier than email
- **2025-05-27 15:52** *User_2Z9G95*: That works! In the interim, we'll have Cory revert to the default and can talk strategy on our call tomorrow, too.

- **2025-05-29 12:56** *User_2Z9G95*: Noted on the 9a ET activation, however, we typically recommend email/SMS sends to be slightly later (1) to give us time to full activate/troubleshoot any issues (especially since pre-orders can be finicky) and (2) to not send it too early to allow people time to wake up and shop.

- **2025-05-29 13:06** *User_2Z9G95*: @Elyse — RE join the waitlist strategy — can I ask the why behind this? Since we already have their emails, what are you looking to do with the information? Segment them and/or send the announcement to them early?  
  
I would maybe propose an SMS push, where we can get people to join SMS for early access. We can send the SMS at like 9:45am ET to give them a bit of a head start before email goes out?

- **2025-05-30 09:00** *User_2Z9G95*: Morning @Elyse — RE discount codes, I was connecting with a Klaviyo and Attentive rep to figure out the best way to go about generating the coupon codes for each platform. They both recommended we create a list of unique codes through Shopify and then upload that list to both Klaviyo and Attentive to pull from. We'd need to select "one use per customer” for the code settings to ensure people can only use one code (even if they get sent two (i.e. if they got one code from Attentive and one from Klaviyo)).  
  
Thoughts? This is likely the best way to ensure people can only use one code, while still leveraging both platforms.  
  
If so, here's what we'd need you to do in Shopify:  
**Go to:** Shopify Admin → **Discounts**  
Click **“Create Discount” → “Discount Code”**  
Choose:  
• Discount Type: e.g., **15% off**  
• Applies to: e.g., all products or your launch collection  
• Limit to one use per customer (highly recommended)  
Under **"Discount Code"**, choose:  
• **“Generate a batch of codes”**  
• Example format: `LAUNCH15-XXXX` (Shopify will auto-randomize)  
• Generate enough for both platforms (e.g., 10,000 codes)  
Save and export the codes as a **CSV**.  
  
From there, I can upload to both Klaviyo and Attentive and get the campaigns scheduled. Let me know what you think, so we can get this going! Thanks!

- **2025-05-30 15:07** *User_2Z9G95*: @Elyse UPDATE RE CODES:  
  
Attentive initially said that they could integrate them so that the same customer via email and SMS would get the same code (awesome!). Now it's sounding like there's a chance it won't work (we'll know shortly), but if it doesn't their recommendation is that the coupon code can only be provided via email *or* SMS.  
  
Since they aren't totally sure, our recommendation is to pivot to a singular Shopify code that doesn't stack with any other discount (i.e. SCULPT20) - that way we're ensuring its a cohesive experience between both CRM channels and SMS isn't left out because of this code consistency issue. Plus, we want this to be a success and it will only be activated for three days and it's product-specific so the risk of a leak is much lower, yet the risk on the customer is much higher if any of the unique ones are broken.  
  
Please let us know your thoughts on this ASAP and we'll update accordingly.

We have great data from MDW, so we're recommending we send to the same list as the engaged MDW segment that drove the strongest performance with some additions (VIPs, MDW purchasers, etc). Confirming all International will be excluded, too.\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-05-30 at 2.49.35 PM.png** (png, 245.6KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F08V4V4SJV7/screenshot_2025-05-30_at_2.49.35___pm.png)

- **2025-06-02 07:49** *User_2Z9G95*: **One other thing we noticed, we wanted to get your thoughts on:**  
It looks like 29 email subscribers and 11 SMS subscribers already purchased the Ritual Body Sculptor Kit, prior to us officially launching via email and SMS. Since they bought full price without the promotion, I can foresee there being some complaints if they find out they can get it for 20% off (after having purchased it at full price).  
  
**Wanted to get your thoughts on two options for how to handle:**  
1. Exclude them from all MBS emails this week since they already purchased (we're going to exclude purchasers from ongoing emails regardless, but there's still a chance they could find out about the 20% off promotion, so we'd need a customer service plan in place to manage complaints if so)  
2. Include them in the MBS email messaging and have a customer service plan in place for people who reach out about purchasing the product prior to receiving the discount and wanting to get the 20% off on their purchase.  
Please let us know how to proceed with the segmenting of these customers!

I thought 3 days was the default, but I realized the brand I worked on previously had manually updated that. I just triple checked in our account and the default in Attentive, which is what we have is: 1 day view thru and 30 days click thru. As we onboard to Postscript we can figure out what theirs is and modify if we see fit.\n\n*Reactions: :+1::skin-tone-3: Elyse*
- **2025-06-03 15:47** *Elyse*: @User*2Z9G95 @User*D39C0Z would also love your thoughts on Alia vs Postscript for popup - if we think Alia’s performance is strong enough to continue beyond free trial or if we think Postscript’s capabilities are just as good and under one roof?  
cc @Ingrid @Chris Jacob
- **2025-06-03 15:54** *User_D39C0Z*: @Elyse our preferred stack is alia popup + postscript backend. we don't use the postscript popup when we have the option for alia as we've historically seen the best results with alia as popup and postscript behind it! cc @User_2Z9G95\n\n*Reactions: :+1::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

- **2025-06-04 13:29** *Elyse*: I think we also have to be careful/mindful of our use of “pain relief” from legal perspective. Using that a lot in the father’s day stuff
- **2025-06-04 13:32** *User_2Z9G95*: Ok good shout! What has legal said specifically? Should we avoid it altogether? What can we say instead? Eases paid, eases sore muscles, etc.?
- **2025-06-04 13:32** *Elyse*: Just that its a bold/medical claim
- **2025-06-04 13:32** *Elyse*: so eases sore muscles, soothes tense muscles etc\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: User_2Z9G95*
- **2025-06-04 13:34** *Elyse*: things of that nature
- **2025-06-04 13:34** *Elyse*: like with MBS, people reported pain relief - we can’t say that, but talent can
- **2025-06-04 13:35** *Elyse*: so if influencer posts oh relieved pain in my sore xyz thats fine, but we can’t say will relieve xyz pain
- **2025-06-04 13:35** *Elyse*: so just wanna be mindful of our use there
- **2025-06-04 13:37** *Elyse*: I’d love if we could take a second spin through Father’s Day doc with that in mind @User_2Z9G95
- **2025-06-04 13:38** *Elyse*: I left a few notes on the doc, circulating to team now as well

- **2025-06-05 09:25** *User_2Z9G95*: Thank you! As a side — I was going through the rest of the existing flows yesterday and wanted to get some clarity on additional ones we can update:  
1. All of the subscription related ones — how recently were those updated? Are you interested in a full redesign or just updating the footer?  
2. What is Reclaim? Are those flows still active and being used? They haven't triggered anything this year so I'm assuming not, but want to check! Safe to say we can disregard those?  
3. Loyalty Lion flows — how recently were those updated? Same note as subscription, we're happy to redesign!
- **2025-06-05 10:04** *Elyse*: All flows probably last updated within maybe a year or two. Could definitely use a full refresh across the board\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: User_2Z9G95*
- **2025-06-05 10:04** *Elyse*: I’d love your thoughts on the Loyalty Lion ones, if there’s anything we can be optimizing there

- **2025-06-06 12:50** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse! Following up here with our finalized Father's Day Strategy. We recommend holding on the third SMS and segmenting the first one to ensure we're targeting those who are engaged first, and then broadening it (to avoid fatigue and overcommunication). Please let us know if you have any thoughts/questions.  
  
• Email 6/8:  
    ◦ Engaged segments (purchasers + non-purchasers)  
• MMS 6/8:  
    ◦ Engaged L365  
• Email 6/9:  
    ◦ Engaged segments (purchasers + non-purchasers), but exclude anyone who just purchased during the sale  
• SMS 6/9:  
    ◦ All subscribers, exclude purchasers  
• Email 6/9: [PM] Engaged segments (purchasers + non-purchasers), but exclude anyone who just purchased during the sale  
With that, these are the two SMS we recommend sending. Please let us know if you're aligned!\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-06 at 10.40.00 AM.png** (png, 261.4KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F09067TU96J/screenshot_2025-06-06_at_10.40.00___am.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-06 at 10.40.11 AM.png** (png, 88.8KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F090B135085/screenshot_2025-06-06_at_10.40.11___am.png)\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

- **2025-06-06 15:08** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Ingrid @Elyse — Happy Friday! Following up with the May CRM deep-dive. [Here's a link to our weekly agenda with May YoY performance and insights at the top](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qW1zFK0lAJNgYV8BTtu4loP*bDVGL7l80a8V0IybvTg/edit?tab=t.0), along with our [CRM Reporting Tracker with MoM totals](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtJOU2541YSnoXC7ccA-RRUy2E*ctEOXQUXO3AdPWU4/edit?gid=1153635090#gid=1153635090).  
  
**May YoY Summary:**  
TLDR; the biggest areas impacting May's performance are a lot of what we've already discussed. We aren't changing much with segmentation apart from broadening where it makes sense and in terms of traffic/recipient's receiving communications, it's all very in-line with last year's metrics. Regardless, here's what heavily impacted that performance:  
  
• Not having a new product launch (like last year)  
• Lower Mother's Day performance (consumers love a gift with purchase)  
• Flows (mainly abandoned checkout, abandoned browse, welcome flow)  
• Broadened campaign segmentation strategy impacted click rates, but allowed us to reach more people and drive significant growth for MDW  
In addition to getting new flow content live ASAP, as an immediate next step, we're going to take a deeper look and how each flow is set up to make sure they're firing correctly. We will keep you posted on findings here!  
  
**On the upside, SMS drove a 100% increase YoY**, so we're going to continue to double down on driving growth and engagement through this channel. If we look at this year's total performance, **May was our strongest month (for both email and SMS), with the lowest declines to date (just 10%).**  
  
**June MTD Summary:**  
**From Shopify — I'm also happy to report that we've sold 758 Body Sculptor Ritual Sets so far, generating $249,711.02 in net sales. We've already driven $111,080.83 from Klaviyo and $86,029.15 from Attentive. Together, we're already 65% towards our CRM revenue goal for June — let's keep it up!**  
  
I hope this information is helpful — as always, please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions!\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

I also created an LA-based segment for the pop-up and we have just over 9K people, so we're happy to get an email drafted for them! I would say we can slate this in the 17th or the 19th (if we wanted to bump the travel to the 17th). Let me know how that sounds and we'll get it going.\n\n📎 **HigherDose CRM Tracker** (gsheet, 0B) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1csFoxkpwWmYtRuRfOE1QssDtjqMcmRm3wYaUGhYDnrg/edit?gid=1474997958#gid=1474997958)\n\n*Reactions: :eyes: Elyse*

• no to promoting nordstrom sale on email  
• big no to promoting amazon sale on email  
• would love some stats on Instant before our call with them, and Sharma analysis on whether we should continue post free trial  
    ◦ same thing with Alia, would love to see stats and Sharma’s analysis on performance thus far
- **2025-06-11 16:09** *User_2Z9G95*: Thank you! Confirming I will get this to you by EOD PT today. Getting the Dad's who DOSE email for tomorrow ready for a preview right now!
- **2025-06-11 16:09** *Elyse*: fab!
- **2025-06-11 16:25** *User_2Z9G95*: @Elyse — Preview sent!
- **2025-06-11 16:26** *Elyse*: its great, good to schedule
- **2025-06-11 16:44** *User_2Z9G95*: Perfect! Confirming this has been scheduled to our 90 days engaged segment. Confirming we've also added a send time A/B test. Looking at L365 on Shopify, we see the most orders/sessions come in between 12p-2p ET and 8p-10p ET. So we've added the test for 12p vs. 8p ET to see if there's any statistically significant differences.\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*
- **2025-06-11 18:48** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse — thanks for your patience here. Please see high-level data and reccos below.  
  
**Summary:**  
TLDR; given our growth goals and what we want to achieve this year, we feel that Alia and Instant would be great integrations to help get us there. Together, both of these will help us better understand our customer journey because we'll have the high-converting pop-up (converting even more new users to subscribers) coupled with engaging flows capturing anonymous users. Both will help expand our lists and get new subscribers further down the funnel (with targeted messaging). Plus, they're both month-to-month, so there's no long-term contracts involved, and are reasonably priced within the market. Plus they have great customer support teams we greatly trust!  
  
**Instant Audiences:**  
I don't have access to Instant's full dashboard (I'm sure we'll get some insight tomorrow), but according to Klaviyo (L30 days), these are the Instant Audience Flows that generated the most revenue:  
• $27,223.08 in additional Klaviyo revenue from their Abandoned Checkout Flow (didn't outperform the regular Abandoned Checkout Flow ($53K), but still contributed incremental revenue)  
• $20,789.18 in additional Klaviyo revenue from their MDW Sale Abandoned Checkout Flow (didn't outperform the regular MDW Sale Abandoned Checkout Flow ($41K), but still contributed incremental revenue)  
• $10,901.45 in additional Klaviyo revenue from their MDW Sale Abandoned Cart Flow (outperformed the regular MDW Sale Abandoned Cart Flow ($8K))  
• $7,729.69 in additional Klaviyo revenue from their Browse Abandonment Flow ((didn't outperform the regular Abandoned Checkout Flow ($30K), but still contributed incremental revenue)  
We're seeing the greatest success from the checkout and cart abandonment flow (which makes sense as this is the furthest down the funnel), but we're eager to get Instant Audience Flows integrated with our new Abandonment Flows that are being designed.  
  
**Alia:**  
For Alia (L30 days), we're seeing:  
• 6.36% email sign up rate  
• 4.62% SMS sign up rate  
In Klaviyo specifically, we hav:  
• 2,373 customers tagged with beauty & skincare  
• 1,961 customers tagged with detox & cleanse  
• 1,569 customers tagged with recovery & muscle relief  
• 1,161 customers tagged with relaxation & stress relief  
• and in total we've captured 10,206 new subscribers from Alia-specific pop-ups  
In Attentive specifically, we have:  
• 779 customers tagged with beauty & skincare  
• 621 customers tagged with detox & cleanse  
• 472 customers tagged with recovery & muscle relief  
• 331 customers tagged with relaxation & stress relief  
• and in total, we've captured 2,757 new subscribers from the Alia-specific pop-ups  
From our previous evergreen Attentive pop-up, we saw about 3%-4% opt-in for email and a 1%-2% opt-in for SMS, so we're definitely seeing improvements with Alia. If there's a concern around how often it's triggering, let's tell the team we want it to only show to new visitors or exclude those who sign up — we have a lot of control in terms of how we want the pop-ups to look/function and Alia gives us a dedicated contact to work through that with us (which is definitely one of the perks!). Having Alia's strong functionality coupled with our new, more personalized welcome flow will also provide an ever better brand intro and customer journey.

- **2025-06-17 17:04** *User_2Z9G95* 💬 5 replies: Hi team — sharing a quick status update from our call today. Link to the agenda **[HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qW1zFK0lAJNgYV8BTtu4loP*bDVGL7l80a8V0IybvTg/edit?tab=t.0)**. High-level summary below:  
  
Account Health:  
The biggest thing I wanted to share with you is that we saw some funky things in the WoW data and after doing a deep dive noticed there was a huge influx in bot clicks this time last year, which is inflating last year's data (making it seem like this year is significantly down when it isn't!). No worries though, nothing is being impacted in our account right now, we just noticed that influx heavily skewed last year's metrics.  
  
*There is an action we can take in the account to remove bot clicks from our data — happy to chat through that more to see if we'd want to do that!*  
  
Flows:  
Flows are moving along — we have a handful [ready for review in the tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1csFoxkpwWmYtRuRfOE1QssDtjqMcmRm3wYaUGhYDnrg/edit?pli=1&amp;gid=1474997958#gid=1474997958).  
  
Campaigns:  
Elyse — if you get a chance to look at [July concepts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gEGU3563QuaRxhUVGw59ckRrGTtbKs5qHkHXnwB*p2M/edit?tab=t.0) this week that would be amazing!

    - **2025-06-17 18:34** *User_2Z9G95*: ↳ Hi @Elyse — Following up on this! There's a Post-Purchase Flow live that is triggering that message. The trigger is "made a purchase", so that's why they got it. Does this flow ring a bell to you? If not, I would recommend we turn it off.\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-17 at 4.34.04 PM.png** (png, 92.6KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F091R6H0LLW/screenshot_2025-06-17_at_4.34.04___pm.png)
- **2025-06-17 18:36** *Elyse*: So @User_2Z9G95 am I understanding this correctly - anyone who makes a purchase at all gets this?
- **2025-06-17 18:39** *User_2Z9G95*: Correct. It's slated to send 10 days after the purchase, so ideally the product has arrived by then, which shouldn't be an issue. But in this case it is. There's a few post-purchase flows live right now. Will take a look at them and see where we need to optimize.
- **2025-06-17 18:39** *Elyse*: Ahhhh ok got it
- **2025-06-17 18:40** *Elyse*: I wonder, is there no way on attentive (which note to self let’s check out on post script) to make the trigger more directly connected to a Shopify action (like tracking add/marked as fulfilled) vs just the general timeline of 10 days?
- **2025-06-17 18:41** *Elyse*: Thinking about orders that arrive sooner but also orders that are on back order or just generally take longer 
- **2025-06-17 18:42** *Elyse*: I mean there’s probably a very very rare scenario where someone gets an order more than ten days later that isn’t related to a back order or preorder 
- **2025-06-17 18:43** *Elyse*: But thinking about when people buy saunas too, that’s def a longer turnaround time than ten days
- **2025-06-17 18:43** *User_2Z9G95*: Yes! There are the same transactional triggers as in Klaviyo (order shipped, order delivered, out for delivery, etc.) — not sure why whoever set this one up did it that way, maybe there was a reason, but we will definitely update when we migrate.\n\n*Reactions: :+1::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

- **2025-07-01 09:49** *User_2Z9G95*: Yes! So the tag needs to be removed from the theme's code. I don't have access to do that, but is there someone on your team who handles dev? There's a script that looks something like this that needs to be removed. I think searching for attn in the theme.liquid will locate it!

- **2025-07-01 13:58** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse @Ingrid — Thank you so much for the time today as always! [Here's a link to the agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qW1zFK0lAJNgYV8BTtu4loP_bDVGL7l80a8V0IybvTg/edit?tab=t.0) for review. I added in an analysis of the unsubscribe rate. TLDR; The major daily spikes in follower loss fell on our heavy promotional days (MBS launch, Father's Day Flash) — no surprise there!  
  
While total unsubscribes increased compared to last year, list growth remains positive (we're bringing in more people than those who are leaving!):  
• Average daily unsubscribes: 144  
• Average daily new subscribers: 296  
    ◦ This shows a strong net growth, with the list expanding at nearly a 2:1 rate.  
And if we look at a average YoY comparison, it’s actually proportional to increased campaign volume and list size. As reach expands, higher unsubscribe rates are expected.  
• June 2024: 193 new subscribers per day, 104 unsubscribes per day  
• June 2025: 296 new subscribers per day, 144 unsubscribes per day  
In sum, there isn't anything alarming — we'll continue to monitor the declines MoM, but everything we're seeing is just a result of more promotional campaigns + an expanding list (which is good!).\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*
- **2025-07-01 14:02** *User_2Z9G95*: I can add in new subscribers to the reporting as well, so we can have the bigger picture of overall list growth moving forward!

- **2025-07-02 13:40** *User_2Z9G95*: @Elyse — RE the Klaviyo code exclusion update, it's all dependent on the collection the code is tied to. The collection it's tied to is called "Can be discounted" so I would assume bundles shouldn't be in there. I don't have access, but can you take a look at that collection and see if bundles are in there? It may be best to remove them, or I can select a different collection if there's a better one to use!

I was just looking and can't seem to find anything live - if not, thinking we can just remove the "get the recipe" CTA and add in a push for high-dration powder - (i.e. Make your own zero-proof mocktail! Our go-to: shake up a stick of High-dration powder with water, pour over ice and top with lime and mint for a refreshing and hydrating drink to sip while you DOSE).

- **2025-07-03 13:19** *User_2Z9G95*: Thank you! Thinking we should probably schedule the email for 3p ET, but let me know if you feel otherwise!
- **2025-07-03 13:22** *User_2Z9G95*: We usually send to an engaged 90 day list, but for this one, we're recommending a send to a L60 engaged to see if a more targeted engaged list could help increase opens/clicks — plus this is a fun, engaging piece that will likely resonate most with our most engaged subscribers.  
  
I've also included a Tri-State area segment and excluded CAN/EU, given the Montauk inclusion, but if you feel like we should include them, let me know!
- **2025-07-03 13:43** *Elyse*: Yeah let’s do it re 3pm

[Here's a link to the initial postscript automations for review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19U*x-DHbtn7dNwNq7JL8xHdkMHOMkOAl8kY0G8o2Wjg/edit?tab=t.0). Let me know if you have any questions! @Ingrid — Feel free to review our weekly summary below + [agenda here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qW1zFK0lAJNgYV8BTtu4loP*bDVGL7l80a8V0IybvTg/edit?tab=t.0)!  
  
Shopify Summary:  
• This year MTD: 0.21% to goal with $30K in revenue   
• Last year MTD: 0.23% to goal with $27K in revenue  
Key Performance Insights:  
• Klaviyo-attributed campaign revenue is down 17% mainly because we've only sent two campaigns so far (two additional will be sent to help us round out the week)  
• Klaviyo-attributed flow revenue is up 53% YoY mainly attributed to our welcome and browse abandonment flows. We saw 150% more recipients receiving these flows which means more people are entering our funnel and are flows are converting them!   
    ◦ After speaking with the paid team, this increase in flow performance/sessions could be attributed to more customers coming in from the combo of AppLovin' and TikTok — adding more touch points into the customer journey.   
• We don't have any SMS-attributed revenue because we're still onboarding. We're hoping to be fully live by tomorrow EOD, so we can start generating revenue from our new campaigns and automations.   
Instant will be joining our next call on Tuesday, so we'll plan to start with an Instant summary at the beginning of that call (5-10 mins) prior to jumping into our weekly.\n\n📎 **HigherDOSE <> Sharma Brands CRM Agenda ** (gdoc, 0B) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qW1zFK0lAJNgYV8BTtu4loP_bDVGL7l80a8V0IybvTg/edit?tab=t.0)\n📎 **FOR REVIEW: Postscript Automations** (gdoc, 107.9KB) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19U_x-DHbtn7dNwNq7JL8xHdkMHOMkOAl8kY0G8o2Wjg/edit?tab=t.0)

- **2025-07-09 12:57** *Elyse* 💬 1 reply: left notes on postscript list - going to show ingrid in a few mins so may have more notes @User_2Z9G95
- **2025-07-09 14:56** *Elyse*: @User*2Z9G95 Ingrid and I just went through all the flows. Here are our notes:  
  
Big takeaway - the abandon series feels very generic/vague with subject lines and preview text. We’d love to run that whole series, plus welcome emails through the **[new product pillars doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TviOjzGtgGUhRuFDcaCLu3ePCtHVB0RDgFUrFvS1bhE/edit?usp=sharing)**. I just saw this for the first time today and think it’s spot on for language and where we want these flows to be. Here’s also the **[new manifesto doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w*C60nIHyiDn_VoDrXSXTJw46C6MyhGS-yrIZMw5AuI/edit?usp=sharing)** - it’s very much a working doc but is a great reference of the voice we want to be speaking in  
  
With replen flow - left notes on figma, but one note for the Shop By Goal design: we’d love to see which version performs better via email campaign. So want to think about where we can put that block into an appropriate email and test whether the lifestyle photo vs product photo does better with engagement and then implement that into the flows  
  
I’m setting up a call with Lauren to review design and everything as a whole for Monday/Tuesday so if we can somehow get outstanding copy polished up before then so I can present everything at once would be sick\n\n📎 **Unknown file** (gdoc, 0B)\n📎 **Unknown file** (gdoc, 0B)
- **2025-07-09 15:01** *Elyse*: Replen flows  
• glow serum email is underwhelming. want to swap out for better photos, and left notes for ingredient highlights  
• detox drops email looks good, want to swap the bottom shop by goal photos a bit so that its not beige beige beige blue  
• oxytocin oil email is missing ingredient breakdown and review highlight  
• highdration powder we loved the ingredient highlight design, and decided for the reviews we’d like to do a single review static image instead of the gif so its not too much to read while in reviews in motion  
    ◦ any emails that are still in copy, we picked which review we want on the doc
- **2025-07-09 15:12** *Elyse*: Same thing for Postscript automations copy - would love to toss that to Chandler and rework through new pillars/manifesto language @User_2Z9G95 I put some notes directly on the doc but want to revisit overall now having those two new docs
- **2025-07-09 15:15** *Elyse*: Diving in to wonderment and loyalty lion emails now
- **2025-07-09 15:31** *Elyse*: @User_2Z9G95 Loyalty Lion emails - would also love to run through those again with the new lens of the pillars/manifesto docs. They feel very generic loyalty, especially the subject lines. Want them to feel more elevated/high end/luxury brand, more exclusive, and more community nurturing if that makes sense
- **2025-07-09 15:33** *Elyse*: Subject line of “Score” is wildly off brand for HD, so must must must rework those
- **2025-07-09 15:42** *Elyse* 💬 1 reply: @User_2Z9G95 could you do me a favor please? Can you send me a test of the order shipped, out for delivery, and delivered emails as they are now please? Want to be able to compare

- **2025-07-10 12:44** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse — A few things for you!  
• Do you have any additional context in regards to the remaining [July concepts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WZsdfIu4Kan39TuUpV45mOOaxyasC-6B45nPEdCL_us/edit?tab=t.pgznx7hfmnnk)? We'd love to get copy finalized this week.   
• Would you like some support in regards to August concepts? Happy to start putting some ideas in if that would be helpful. We would love to have concepts finalized by early next week (at least the first half), so that we can start briefing those out.   
• I'll dive into your feedback on all flow-related items this afternoon!  
• Chandler is working on the Postscript copy today, so I'll let you know when that's ready for review.

- **2025-07-11 09:32** *Elyse*: @User_2Z9G95 just looked a postscript updated copy - moving in a better direction. so i do love the “lit up, deeply restored, and unapologetically radiant” i just think we shouldn’t say it back to back in like a handful of different texts. like imagine you’re a customer and get it in the welcome flow, then you abandon something you’re seeing that copy again, etc it feels redundant in a spot where we have opportunity to say something different each time  
@Ingrid do you have any thoughts here? [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LV6UztdwwUQGe99PbAWYZ4-NmgOf6Y3WDEyTgPTIKhQ/edit?tab=t.0) are the updates\n\n📎 **Unknown file** (gdoc, 0B)

- **2025-07-11 12:07** *User_2Z9G95* 💬 3 replies: Hi @Elyse! I just connected with Chandler and she's working through the flows today and early next week. Given that some of the emails need to be completely re-thought and re-done, we won't be able to have everything ready by Monday or Tuesday next week. Here's a summary of what we can do though:  
• By Monday EOD:  
    ◦ 7/21 campaign  
    ◦ 7/25 campaign  
    ◦ Replenishment flows  
    ◦ Abandoned Cart  
    ◦ Abandoned Checkout  
• By Tuesday EOD:  
    ◦ Abandoned Browse  
• By Wednesday EOD:  
    ◦ Wonderment flows  
    ◦ Loyalty Lion flows  
Given that the Welcome needs another re-write with the new TOV doc, we won't be able to have that done for early next week. We're moving to keep pushing these along as quickly as we can and appreciate your patience as we continue to work through these.  
  
We also had a few questions on some feedback left:  
• I saw you left a comment in [this Figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/tS7RlljzjfnN1HZZYe0l2L/HigherDOSE-%E2%80%93-Flows?node-id=33332-2180&amp;p=f&amp;t=AyOdrmbkH5d1DFMB-0) about providing copy. Is the plan just to condense that's already in there? Or what exactly needs to be modified? Thank you!  
• And for [this one](https://www.figma.com/design/tS7RlljzjfnN1HZZYe0l2L/HigherDOSE-%E2%80%93-Flows?node-id=39049-706&amp;t=E9aBNCdqOehg4OEI-0), do you have the one-liner about being fragrance-free/the scent we can add?  
I just realized I never sent you the tests for order update emails — so sorry! I actually can't send previews of transactional emails that are live, so I'll thread screenshots for you now, so you can review [those](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EkwlQlnlt16vUmyOQIjFMry4VW1bjBkJCvk1yUBuEqo/edit?tab=t.0)! Keep us posted on feedback there.  
  
One other outstanding item:  
1. We're waiting on some more context for the [Permission to Play](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WZsdfIu4Kan39TuUpV45mOOaxyasC-6B45nPEdCL_us/edit?tab=t.pgznx7hfmnnk) concepts for July.  
**One note from us:** Chandler will be OOO 7/21-7/25 and we're hoping to have the first week of August content in hand ASAP so she can get copy drafted for them. I see something about the Red Light Wrap Launch — if that's happening we need to have all context by early next week for us to work on the copy (+ we'd need to pause work on flows to accommodate that new product launch). Please let us know ASAP on that!

We're working to evolve our internal briefing process and were thinking we could also implement this to help streamline our approval process with you all, too! As you're building out August concepts, would you be able to integrate this framework for them so that we can ensure we're giving the team as much information upfront as possible? I know we don't always have access to the info this far in advance (totally fine), but the more info we can share the better! I'm also happy to support where needed — let me know your thoughts!

• If additional research is needed from our team, please link any helpful resources (or let us know where we should be diving deeper):

- **2025-07-15 11:34** *User_2Z9G95*: Today's preview coming shortly @Elyse!
- **2025-07-15 11:54** *User_2Z9G95*: A/B test previews sent! Is there a data point in particular you're looking for with the A/B test? The "Finally here" one feels pretty promotional and doesn't give much context into what's inside the email (which is a really cool Q&amp;A). I'm wondering if the initial version that calls out Helen Leland is better to lean into here? Or maybe we can modify it slightly to A/B test leaning with the product in the subject versus leading with the narrative in the subject. Curious if calling out Q&amp;A directly drives stronger engagement, too, since we typically see those perform well!  
  
**Version A: Original**  
**Subject:** Finally here: The Microcurrent Body Sculptor  
**Preview:** Shipping is live — grab yours now  
  
**Version A: NEW**  
**Subject:** Now Shipping: The Microcurrent Body Sculptor  
**Preview:** + A Q&amp;A with Helen Leland  
  
**Version B:**   
**Subject:** The (new) summer body with Helen Leland  
**Preview:** Activate your postural muscles with the Microcurrent Body Sculptor  
  
This is what we had for the Father's Day Q&amp;A, that drove a really high open rate.  
Subject: Dads who DOSE: Meet David  
Preview text: A Father’s Day Q&amp;A  
  
LMK your thoughts! Will get it scheduled ASAP.

I'll of course be available if anything comes up, but we should be in a really good place by Thursday with things approved/scheduled out. Let's stay close! Feel free to tag @User*5S72LT with any edit requests or questions while I'm out/for an extra set of eyes. Thank you, both!! CC: @User*D39C0Z

- **2025-07-16 12:19** *Chris Jacob*: Hi all can you advise on any key outbound email dates planned for the next week? We need to rollover the domain hosting which could cause a hiccup in this regard and we should probably also test a small outbound email once its setup new to make sure there's no issues

- **2025-07-16 18:09** *Elyse*: @User_2Z9G95 both previews good to go
- **2025-07-17 13:42** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse + @Ingrid — I wanted to share some notes on a discount strategy for our abandoned flows. I've included what is live today and what we'd recommend changing below. Based on your feedback, I think we're all on the same page, but let us know if you have any other thoughts:  
  
• WELCOME10:  
    ◦ 10% off code that is live in Welcome Email #1, Site Abandonment Email #1, #2, and #3  
        ▪︎ We'd recommend including this in at least one other Welcome Email as well (last chance/driving urgency)  
        ▪︎ We'd recommend removing this from all Site Abandonment emails (top of funnel is focused on awareness/brand)  
• HIGHERSELF10:  
    ◦ 10% off code that is live in Abandoned Checkout Email #1 and Email #2  
    ◦ We'd recommend removing it from Abandoned Checkout email #1 and leaving it in just email #2.   
• FLASH10:  
    ◦ 10% off code that is live in Abandoned Browse Email #2, and Abandoned Cart Email #2  
    ◦ We'd recommend removing this from all Abandoned Browse emails (top of funnel is focused on awareness/brand)  
    ◦ We'd recommend leaving it in just Abandoned Cart email #2.   
I know we mentioned wanting to remove all FLASH messaging as well — if you'd like us to create a new code to put in the abandoned cart emails, let us know!  
  
All copy docs have been updated to reflect this strategy, but I just wanted to cover off on the updates we're making from the existing flows. Let us know if you have any questions!
- **2025-07-17 13:52** *Elyse*: Aligned on all of the above
- **2025-07-17 13:52** *Elyse*: @Ingrid confirm good by you?

- **2025-07-18 17:10** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse + @Ingrid! As discussed, I wanted to pass along an update of where we're at MTD. So far, we're up 32% YoY (email + SMS combined). Now that we've launched Postscript, we're pacing closer to our goal. We're 58% through the month and we're 64% to our goal. We have a strong content marketing strategy planned for the rest of the month, so we're confident in maintaining momentum. We'll continue to monitor performance closely and optimize in real time to ensure we finish strong. We've made great progress on the email flows this week and are excited to hear Lauren's thoughts next week. Let us know if you have any questions. Enjoy the weekend!\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Sumish Khadka, :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

- **2025-07-22 18:51** *User_2Z9G95*: Hey team! Sorry for the delay — [here's a link to the agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qW1zFK0lAJNgYV8BTtu4loP_bDVGL7l80a8V0IybvTg/edit?tab=t.0) we reviewed today and a high-level summary below:  
  
We're 70% through the month and 77% to our goal, so we're still pacing above and maintaining good momentum. We've driven $109K so far, so we're looking to drive $33K more. We have 6 more emails going out and 2 more SMS, so we should be in a good place.  
  
In regards to the flows, we went through all of the feedback and have put together this go-forward plan:  
• Hannah to build out templates of all 7 emails based on feedback  
• Hannah to send templates to Elyse for review/approval  
• Once approved, Elyse will get approval from Ingrid/Lauren/all stakeholders  
• Once approved, Hannah/Chandler will update copy over the next week + pass along to Elyse to review/approve with Ingrid/Lauren/all stakeholders  
• Once approved, Hannah will pass to design  
I'm hoping to have the templates done tomorrow, so you can have those ready to review and we can keep moving these along.\n\n📎 **HigherDOSE <> Sharma Brands CRM Agenda ** (gdoc, 0B) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qW1zFK0lAJNgYV8BTtu4loP_bDVGL7l80a8V0IybvTg/edit?tab=t.0)\n\n*Reactions: :1000: Elyse*

I’m reaching out with a bit of a bittersweet update — I’ll be leaving Sharma Brands as of Monday and moving on to a new chapter. I'm incredibly grateful to have learned so much about your company and to have started working with you on the revamp of your flows.  
  
The good news: you’re in amazing hands moving forward. I’m thrilled to introduce you to @User*2Z9G95, who will be taking over your account, working closely with @User*4PNMDE and has already been working on your audit behind the scenes. She’s an amazing email strategist, and I know you’re going to love working with her.  
  
The rest of the CRM and creative team — including our designers and copywriter — will remain the same, so you’re in excellent hands all around.  
  
We’re working closely behind the scenes to ensure a smooth and seamless transition, and I’ll be around to support during this handoff period as well.  
  
Thank you so much again — wishing you continued success, and I hope our paths cross again in the future.  
Best,

- **2025-04-18 11:24** *Elyse*: Hi @User_2Z9G95 happy Friday! We’re evaluating overall email performance YoY, and want to gain a better understanding of why email is the only channel thats down 40% YoY. Can you put together an analysis for us please? Ideally looking for opportunities for go forward growth, as well as analysis on the last year.
- **2025-04-18 11:25** *Elyse*: Also @User_2Z9G95 we should be meeting internally on Monday for May messaging, so will have some key content themes for you/for May email calendar by Tuesday.
- **2025-04-18 17:23** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse — thank you for letting us know! Absolutely. We'll put together some insights and a go-forward strategy for our call on Tuesday. A few clarifying questions:  
• Where are you finding these results? Given attribution differences across platforms, we want to better understand where you're pulling your numbers.   
• What's the exact timeframe you're looking at? Are you looking at year-to-date data? To clarify, you're seeing a 40% drop in performance from Jan - Apr 2025 compared to Jan - Apr 2024?   
As a side — we've built out the briefs for the [Welcome Flow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KwAEJZIfJ302SX-vD8Lp*RqwH24hTFey*5XqJP_zbqQ/edit?tab=t.0) and [Replenishment Flow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-iCIB6Cvc43jP1k-EAYnWvCXr4Ge0Jkl13ihjW1YnT8/edit?tab=t.0), which are ready for your review. This is a high-level summary of what we're briefing out to our copywriters, so if there's any specific call-outs or any specific narratives we should be sharing, please add comments directly into the document. Once drafted, we'll pass them back to you all for final review and then we'll brief them out to our designers.  
  
Next week, we'll dive into optimizations within your Site Abandonment, Cart Abandonment, and Browse Abandonment flows — which will then follow a similar process. [I've created this CRM Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1csFoxkpwWmYtRuRfOE1QssDtjqMcmRm3wYaUGhYDnrg/edit?gid=1474997958#gid=1474997958) that will keep track of everything we're working on: Flows, Campaigns, and SMS (including any tests we're running). Please feel free to reference this if you have any questions in regards to status updates (of course, you can always reach out, too!).  
  
We'll standby for the updated May messaging.  
  
Please let me know if you have any questions, thanks!\n\n📎 **HigherDOSE CRM | Welcome Flow Audit, V2** (gdoc, 155.4KB) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KwAEJZIfJ302SX-vD8Lp_RqwH24hTFey_5XqJP_zbqQ/edit?tab=t.0)\n📎 **HigherDose CRM Tracker** (gsheet, 0B) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1csFoxkpwWmYtRuRfOE1QssDtjqMcmRm3wYaUGhYDnrg/edit?gid=1474997958#gid=1474997958)\n\n*Reactions: :+1::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

- **2025-04-28 13:06** *Elyse*: @User_2Z9G95 feedback on welcome flow copy from Lauren on our end:  
  
• Phrases like “grueling 9–5” and “life admin” feel a little cliché and casual. HigherDOSE typically feels more aspirational and less whiny about life’s stressors.  
• Some copy feels a bit basic (“Life is tiring. It’s never-ending.“) HigherDOSE usually sounds smarter, more energized, and more magnetic.  
• It’s missing a bit of that “sexy science” vibe — the feeling that you’re unlocking ancient wisdom and cutting-edge tech, and being seduced into self-care.  
• Good that they’re describing how you’ll feel but it could paint the sensory experience more! (HigherDOSE often invites you into a “felt” transformation!

We have a few thoughts to share: It turns out this customer is actually based in the UK — so they haven't been receiving any of the promotional messaging, they've only received campaigns and flows. It does look like this customer received two flow emails (Site and Browse) on the same day. To prevent this from happening in the future, we can add more specific profile filters (i.e. if customer is in X flow, prevent them from entering Y flow).  In addition, we also recommend turning on smart sending for all campaigns to help prevent this overlap. With Klaviyo's smart sending feature on — it prevents someone from receiving multiple emails within a 16 hour period. Because this wasn't in place, they've received all flow and campaign communication, which is likely what prompted them to reach out. We can also certainly create a preference page should people choose to customize their exclusions — we don't typically recommend relying solely on this — but with a strategic campaign segmentation strategy we should be able to prevent this from happening in the future!  
  
The good news: Klaviyo's unsubscribe rate is only up 7% L7 days over the previous 7 days, so the send rate isn't having too large of an impact on the rest of our community. In regards to long-term strategy implications — best practice is between 2-3 campaign sends per week, 4 can be pushing it, unless strategically segmented. We can put together a stronger segmentation strategy based what people viewed, previously ordered, etc. This is the strategy we recommend implementing moving forward. In regards to the campaigns themselves, given the feedback we've heard to date from you all, we're recommending a quality over quantity approach, where we'll be able to dive deeper into the stories, narratives, and data. We'll, of course, want to A/B test more longer-form content against shorter-form content to find what resonates most with our community, but regardless, we're excited about implementing this new longer-form, educational approach.  
  
I hope that helps provide some context! If there's anything else I can help clarify or dive deeper into, please let me know.\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Elyse*

- **2025-05-07 10:19** *User_2Z9G95*: No worries! Happy to push to tomorrow, too? It's not ideal with the back-to-back sale emails, but I can see what we can do from a segmentation standpoint.
- **2025-05-07 10:22** *Elyse*: let’s see, hopefully can keep online for today. i just texted\n\n*Reactions: :sparkling_heart: User_2Z9G95*

- **2025-05-07 11:32** *User_2Z9G95*: Sounds great! Thank you so much!
- **2025-05-07 13:07** *Elyse*: ok just looked through - only thing we need to add is a read more button and some kind of sentence leading into that CTA like read more about my journey into motherhood on our blog or something

- **2025-05-07 13:59** *User_2Z9G95*: @Elyse — Did Lauren's blog post already go live? If so, can you share the link? Thank you!
- **2025-05-07 14:47** *User_2Z9G95*: @Elyse – Just sent you the preview. We just need the blog link that I can add to that button! Let me know if there's any thoughts/feedback (the last two paragraphs are new, so please review those!). Since this is still a text-based email, we have pretty limited control in terms of the background design, so we went with more of a beige/off-white background color to add some dimension.
- **2025-05-07 14:54** *Elyse*: bckground fine by me\n\n*Reactions: :+1: User_2Z9G95*
- **2025-05-07 14:57** *Elyse*: one note - we say “might resonate” twice so thinking for bottom blurb:  
  
Even though I’m better able to prioritize self-care now, getting to this point wasn’t easy. I ignored so many warning signs until my body physically forced me to stop with a grand mal seizure. If you’re curious about my journey through motherhood, you can read my full blog post below.  
  
Happy Mother’s Day–to every woman discovering that choosing herself is not selfish, but one of the most powerful ways she can show up for the people she loves.

As next steps, we'll:  
• Look at top-performing evergreen campaigns from last year (+ continue building out the campaign calendar)  
• Provide a weekly reporting summary to keep track of YoY performance  
• Keep flows moving ASAP\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse, :raised_hands: Ingrid*
- **2025-05-13 18:04** *User_2Z9G95*: @Elyse — Just an FYI, outside of the promos, the following were the top revenue-driving campaigns from mid-May to mid-June last year — no surprise, most are red light hat related, so I think a takeaway here is to replicate some (or all) of these stories post MBS launch:  
• Infrared saunas vs. traditional saunas  
• Red light hat before and after (this would be good pre-Father's Day)  
• Red light hat customer feature (also good pre-Father's Day)  
• Red light FAQs  
• Frequency matters - Frequency FAQ\n\n*Reactions: :+1::skin-tone-3: Elyse*
- **2025-05-14 11:47** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse — Looking forward to our copy chat this afternoon! If the team is able to share (either live on the call or after) examples that really nail down the tone of voice that would be helpful. Having a visual/seeing the examples IRL makes it much easier for us to understand. If there's any old email examples, pages on your site, or blog posts we can dissect together that would be fabulous.\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse, :eyes: Elyse*

I think potentially a launch on paid of 5/22 was mentioned, but our formal recco is to move forward with 5/21 as a lot of the market is already on sale and the longer period will benefit the ad learnings! cc @User*D39C0Z @User_2Z9G95\n\n📎 **HigherDOSE MDW Plan** (gdoc, 0B) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HIM62VuEVzgaNKz0FClHa3v0Ckvmcg-4JlDRVh_MX00/edit?tab=t.0)\n\n*Reactions: :pray: User_D39C0Z*

When we switch to full launch, we'll just swap out the early access messaging in the subject line for email 1 and the early access messaging in the SMS copy.  
  
Other than that, this is what our welcome flow will be for the promo! Please add in any comments directly. @Elyse — I left one comment for you about bolding the reviews, let me know your thoughts!

- **2025-05-19 18:04** *User_2Z9G95*: @Elyse — Here's our broad segmentation strategy for review! Last year, each email that was sent to the same broad engaged segment reached about 150,000 people, so this year we're broadening it to closer to 290,000. You'll see we have a mix of engaged, unengaged, and lapsed customers:  
  
**Engaged:**  
• 365 days engaged (broadening to people who engaged all year — they're likely waiting for this sale period!)  
• Purchasers (All Time)  
• 180 days engaged, never purchased (Targeted + Broad - difference here depends on how many emails they've received from us; targeted means they received more emails, so they're slightly more engaged)  
• Clicked/opened at least once in the last 365 days, never bought  
**Unengaged:**  
• 180 days unengaged (don't want this to be too broad (365), so we can ensure we're reaching people who haven't engaged without sacrificing engagement too much)  
• Never purchased   
• Never engaged, subscribed 60+ days ago  
**Lapsed:**  
• VIPs - Purchased more than once, but not in the last 60 days  
• Was engaged 30-60 days ago, but not recently (have purchased at somepoint)  
• Purchased once at least 60 days ago, but hasn't opened or clicked in the last 90  
I'll be able to follow up with the re-send segmentation strategy tomorrow once we get some data, but it will likely be those who didn't open and/or didn't click + didn't purchase.  
  
We'll monitor performance and if we need to remove some of the broad unengaged segments, we certainly can! Will keep you posted.  
  
***Question: Any other exclusions we should be aware of? Is the Red Light Hat available abroad? I looked at the sheet you initially shared, but the row isn't filled out. I think that's the only product that's getting a spotlight.*** \n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-05-19 at 2.41.40 PM.png** (png, 176.1KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F08T56Q129G/screenshot_2025-05-19_at_2.41.40___pm.png)

Additionally — the site, browse, and cart abandonment flows we copied each have one campaign, however, to further target these high-intent purchasers, we're recommending adding an additional campaign to be sent 25 hours after the first initial send. We've gone ahead and copied existing flows to create these campaigns and @Elyse — I would love to send those through for review ASAP so we can get them live!  
  
Let me know if there's any thoughts/feedback on the above. Thank you all!\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-05-21 at 11.05.22 AM.png** (png, 104.8KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F08T6CH1JP5/screenshot_2025-05-21_at_11.05.22___am.png)\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Elyse*

• Can we get them added to our master list, and send them the welcome flow but with a special code in it and some copy around like “great to meet you at the Ject Miami event. Welcome to the higherdose community” etc something along those lines. here’s a code to use for a week   
• Code will be HDJect30 from lmk when we can get this email out to a week from then

And then we have two options for the plain text last chance email on 5/26 — I noticed that in the past HD sends an actual plain-text email, but our team also designed one. Sending through both for you to see which feels better! Alternatively, we can send on in the AM and one in the PM for a last min re-send opportunity.  
  
These are templates, not the campaigns so ignore the subject and preview for now.

CC: @Ingrid Letting you know everything for this weekend is scheduled and updated [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1csFoxkpwWmYtRuRfOE1QssDtjqMcmRm3wYaUGhYDnrg/edit?pli=1&gid=1474997958#gid=1474997958). We made a few tweaks to this weekend's segments. Since these emails are more product-focused and narrative in messaging, we tweaked the segments to be more engaged-driven. We removed any unengaged segments from this (which will ideally help drive click and open rate back up). We also included engaged, product-focused segments, focusing on those with higher-intent — see below:  
  
• Red Light Hat Spotlight: Added: Engaged L180, but never purchased Red Light Hat  
• PEMF Spotlight: Added: Engaged L180, but never purchased anything from the PEMF collection  
• Father's Day Gifting: Added: Engaged L180, but never purchased anything from the PEMF or Red Light collection  
I've included the full segment breakdown in the sheet if you want to see the others! Let us know if you have any thoughts, but we think targeting engaged segments for the weekend sends will put us in a great place engagement and conversion wise come Monday and Tuesday, when we're ready to double down on last minute/extended sale messaging to our initial broad audience.\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

- **2025-05-27 15:51** *Elyse*: let me check with ingrid on that when shes back in office tomorrow. think we’d be okay with it as we’re starting social teasers earlier than email
- **2025-05-27 15:52** *User_2Z9G95*: That works! In the interim, we'll have Cory revert to the default and can talk strategy on our call tomorrow, too.
- **2025-05-27 15:52** *Elyse*: perfect tysm!

• teaser 2: love the shadow verson, absolutely nails the teaser vibe  
    ◦ top link we want to direct to a JOIN THE WAITLIST cta - how can we do this on klaviyo? want to be able to tag those customers as having signed up thru this campaign, even though we’re gonna send it wide anyway  
    ◦ bottom link - we’re gonna make a quick category on the blog home page to have all lymphatic/microcurrent/“flow” related blogs in one place so will link to that landing page there\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: User_2Z9G95*

- **2025-05-29 12:56** *User_2Z9G95*: Noted on the 9a ET activation, however, we typically recommend email/SMS sends to be slightly later (1) to give us time to full activate/troubleshoot any issues (especially since pre-orders can be finicky) and (2) to not send it too early to allow people time to wake up and shop. Are you open to a 10a ET launch for both email and SMS?\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

- **2025-05-29 13:06** *User_2Z9G95*: @Elyse — RE join the waitlist strategy — can I ask the why behind this? Since we already have their emails, what are you looking to do with the information? Segment them and/or send the announcement to them early?  
  
I would maybe propose an SMS push, where we can get people to join SMS for early access. We can send the SMS at like 9:45am ET to give them a bit of a head start before email goes out?

- **2025-05-30 09:00** *User_2Z9G95*: Morning @Elyse — RE discount codes, I was connecting with a Klaviyo and Attentive rep to figure out the best way to go about generating the coupon codes for each platform. They both recommended we create a list of unique codes through Shopify and then upload that list to both Klaviyo and Attentive to pull from. We'd need to select "one use per customer” for the code settings to ensure people can only use one code (even if they get sent two (i.e. if they got one code from Attentive and one from Klaviyo)).  
  
Thoughts? This is likely the best way to ensure people can only use one code, while still leveraging both platforms.  
  
If so, here's what we'd need you to do in Shopify:  
**Go to:** Shopify Admin → **Discounts**  
Click **“Create Discount” → “Discount Code”**  
Choose:  
• Discount Type: e.g., **15% off**  
• Applies to: e.g., all products or your launch collection  
• Limit to one use per customer (highly recommended)  
Under **"Discount Code"**, choose:  
• **“Generate a batch of codes”**  
• Example format: `LAUNCH15-XXXX` (Shopify will auto-randomize)  
• Generate enough for both platforms (e.g., 10,000 codes)  
Save and export the codes as a **CSV**.  
  
From there, I can upload to both Klaviyo and Attentive and get the campaigns scheduled. Let me know what you think, so we can get this going! Thanks!

- **2025-05-30 15:07** *User_2Z9G95*: @Elyse UPDATE RE CODES:  
  
Attentive initially said that they could integrate them so that the same customer via email and SMS would get the same code (awesome!). Now it's sounding like there's a chance it won't work (we'll know shortly), but if it doesn't their recommendation is that the coupon code can only be provided via email *or* SMS.  
  
Since they aren't totally sure, our recommendation is to pivot to a singular Shopify code that doesn't stack with any other discount (i.e. SCULPT20) - that way we're ensuring its a cohesive experience between both CRM channels and SMS isn't left out because of this code consistency issue. Plus, we want this to be a success and it will only be activated for three days and it's product-specific so the risk of a leak is much lower, yet the risk on the customer is much higher if any of the unique ones are broken.  
  
Please let us know your thoughts on this ASAP and we'll update accordingly.

We have great data from MDW, so we're recommending we send to the same list as the engaged MDW segment that drove the strongest performance with some additions (VIPs, MDW purchasers, etc).

- **2025-06-02 07:49** *User_2Z9G95*: **One other thing we noticed, we wanted to get your thoughts on:**  
It looks like 29 email subscribers and 11 SMS subscribers already purchased the Ritual Body Sculptor Kit, prior to us officially launching via email and SMS. Since they bought full price without the promotion, I can foresee there being some complaints if they find out they can get it for 20% off (after having purchased it at full price).  
  
**Wanted to get your thoughts on two options for how to handle:**  
1. Exclude them from all MBS emails this week since they already purchased (we're going to exclude purchasers from ongoing emails regardless, but there's still a chance they could find out about the 20% off promotion, so we'd need a customer service plan in place to manage complaints if so)  
2. Include them in the MBS email messaging and have a customer service plan in place for people who reach out about purchasing the product prior to receiving the discount and wanting to get the 20% off on their purchase.  
Please let us know how to proceed with the segmenting of these customers!

- **2025-06-02 07:51** *Elyse*: Since they purchased prior to launch, I’d want them to get the launch emails and see what it’s all about officially

I thought 3 days was the default, but I realized the brand I worked on previously had manually updated that. I just triple checked in our account and the default in Attentive, which is what we have is: 1 day view thru and 30 days click thru. As we onboard to Postscript we can figure out what theirs is and modify if we see fit.\n\n*Reactions: :+1::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

cc @Ingrid @Chris Jacob
- **2025-06-03 15:54** *User_D39C0Z*: @Elyse our preferred stack is alia popup + postscript backend. we don't use the postscript popup when we have the option for alia as we've historically seen the best results with alia as popup and postscript behind it! cc @User_2Z9G95\n\n*Reactions: :+1::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

- **2025-06-04 13:32** *User_2Z9G95*: Ok good shout! What has legal said specifically? Should we avoid it altogether? What can we say instead? Eases paid, eases sore muscles, etc.?
- **2025-06-04 13:32** *Elyse*: Just that its a bold/medical claim
- **2025-06-04 13:32** *Elyse*: so eases sore muscles, soothes tense muscles etc\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: User_2Z9G95*
- **2025-06-04 13:34** *Elyse*: things of that nature

- **2025-06-05 09:25** *User_2Z9G95*: Thank you! As a side — I was going through the rest of the existing flows yesterday and wanted to get some clarity on additional ones we can update:  
1. All of the subscription related ones — how recently were those updated? Are you interested in a full redesign or just updating the footer?  
2. What is Reclaim? Are those flows still active and being used? They haven't triggered anything this year so I'm assuming not, but want to check! Safe to say we can disregard those?  
3. Loyalty Lion flows — how recently were those updated? Same note as subscription, we're happy to redesign!
- **2025-06-05 10:04** *Elyse*: All flows probably last updated within maybe a year or two. Could definitely use a full refresh across the board\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: User_2Z9G95*

- **2025-06-06 12:50** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse! Following up here with our finalized Father's Day Strategy. We recommend holding on the third SMS and segmenting the first one to ensure we're targeting those who are engaged first, and then broadening it (to avoid fatigue and overcommunication). Please let us know if you have any thoughts/questions.  
  
• Email 6/8:  
    ◦ Engaged segments (purchasers + non-purchasers)  
• MMS 6/8:  
    ◦ Engaged L365  
• Email 6/9:  
    ◦ Engaged segments (purchasers + non-purchasers), but exclude anyone who just purchased during the sale  
• SMS 6/9:  
    ◦ All subscribers, exclude purchasers  
• Email 6/9: [PM] Engaged segments (purchasers + non-purchasers), but exclude anyone who just purchased during the sale  
With that, these are the two SMS we recommend sending. Please let us know if you're aligned!\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-06 at 10.40.00 AM.png** (png, 261.4KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F09067TU96J/screenshot_2025-06-06_at_10.40.00___am.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-06 at 10.40.11 AM.png** (png, 88.8KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F090B135085/screenshot_2025-06-06_at_10.40.11___am.png)\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

- **2025-06-06 15:08** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Ingrid @Elyse — Happy Friday! Following up with the May CRM deep-dive. [Here's a link to our weekly agenda with May YoY performance and insights at the top](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qW1zFK0lAJNgYV8BTtu4loP*bDVGL7l80a8V0IybvTg/edit?tab=t.0), along with our [CRM Reporting Tracker with MoM totals](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtJOU2541YSnoXC7ccA-RRUy2E*ctEOXQUXO3AdPWU4/edit?gid=1153635090#gid=1153635090).  
  
**May YoY Summary:**  
TLDR; the biggest areas impacting May's performance are a lot of what we've already discussed. We aren't changing much with segmentation apart from broadening where it makes sense and in terms of traffic/recipient's receiving communications, it's all very in-line with last year's metrics. Regardless, here's what heavily impacted that performance:  
  
• Not having a new product launch (like last year)  
• Lower Mother's Day performance (consumers love a gift with purchase)  
• Flows (mainly abandoned checkout, abandoned browse, welcome flow)  
• Broadened campaign segmentation strategy impacted click rates, but allowed us to reach more people and drive significant growth for MDW  
In addition to getting new flow content live ASAP, as an immediate next step, we're going to take a deeper look and how each flow is set up to make sure they're firing correctly. We will keep you posted on findings here!  
  
**On the upside, SMS drove a 100% increase YoY**, so we're going to continue to double down on driving growth and engagement through this channel. If we look at this year's total performance, **May was our strongest month (for both email and SMS), with the lowest declines to date (just 10%).**  
  
**June MTD Summary:**  
**From Shopify — I'm also happy to report that we've sold 758 Body Sculptor Ritual Sets so far, generating $249,711.02 in net sales. We've already driven $111,080.83 from Klaviyo and $86,029.15 from Attentive. Together, we're already 65% towards our CRM revenue goal for June — let's keep it up!**  
  
I hope this information is helpful — as always, please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions!\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

So we've added the test for 12p vs. 8p ET to see if there's any statistically significant differences.\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*
- **2025-06-11 18:48** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse — thanks for your patience here. Please see high-level data and reccos below.  
  
**Summary:**  
TLDR; given our growth goals and what we want to achieve this year, we feel that Alia and Instant would be great integrations to help get us there. Together, both of these will help us better understand our customer journey because we'll have the high-converting pop-up (converting even more new users to subscribers) coupled with engaging flows capturing anonymous users. Both will help expand our lists and get new subscribers further down the funnel (with targeted messaging). Plus, they're both month-to-month, so there's no long-term contracts involved, and are reasonably priced within the market. Plus they have great customer support teams we greatly trust!  
  
**Instant Audiences:**  
I don't have access to Instant's full dashboard (I'm sure we'll get some insight tomorrow), but according to Klaviyo (L30 days), these are the Instant Audience Flows that generated the most revenue:  
• $27,223.08 in additional Klaviyo revenue from their Abandoned Checkout Flow (didn't outperform the regular Abandoned Checkout Flow ($53K), but still contributed incremental revenue)  
• $20,789.18 in additional Klaviyo revenue from their MDW Sale Abandoned Checkout Flow (didn't outperform the regular MDW Sale Abandoned Checkout Flow ($41K), but still contributed incremental revenue)  
• $10,901.45 in additional Klaviyo revenue from their MDW Sale Abandoned Cart Flow (outperformed the regular MDW Sale Abandoned Cart Flow ($8K))  
• $7,729.69 in additional Klaviyo revenue from their Browse Abandonment Flow ((didn't outperform the regular Abandoned Checkout Flow ($30K), but still contributed incremental revenue)  
We're seeing the greatest success from the checkout and cart abandonment flow (which makes sense as this is the furthest down the funnel), but we're eager to get Instant Audience Flows integrated with our new Abandonment Flows that are being designed.  
  
**Alia:**  
For Alia (L30 days), we're seeing:  
• 6.36% email sign up rate  
• 4.62% SMS sign up rate  
In Klaviyo specifically, we hav:  
• 2,373 customers tagged with beauty & skincare  
• 1,961 customers tagged with detox & cleanse  
• 1,569 customers tagged with recovery & muscle relief  
• 1,161 customers tagged with relaxation & stress relief  
• and in total we've captured 10,206 new subscribers from Alia-specific pop-ups  
In Attentive specifically, we have:  
• 779 customers tagged with beauty & skincare  
• 621 customers tagged with detox & cleanse  
• 472 customers tagged with recovery & muscle relief  
• 331 customers tagged with relaxation & stress relief  
• and in total, we've captured 2,757 new subscribers from the Alia-specific pop-ups  
From our previous evergreen Attentive pop-up, we saw about 3%-4% opt-in for email and a 1%-2% opt-in for SMS, so we're definitely seeing improvements with Alia. If there's a concern around how often it's triggering, let's tell the team we want it to only show to new visitors or exclude those who sign up — we have a lot of control in terms of how we want the pop-ups to look/function and Alia gives us a dedicated contact to work through that with us (which is definitely one of the perks!). Having Alia's strong functionality coupled with our new, more personalized welcome flow will also provide an ever better brand intro and customer journey.

- **2025-06-12 10:00** *User_2Z9G95*: @Elyse — [I also started building this doc for July concepts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gEGU3563QuaRxhUVGw59ckRrGTtbKs5qHkHXnwB_p2M/edit?tab=t.0). We'd love to have these concepts locked in by tomorrow EOD, so we can start briefing the ideas out. They don't need to be fully fleshed out yet, we just want high-level concept approval! I left a note for you at the top — this was all pulled from the Q3 strategy, so please let me know if there's anything else we need/want to integrate. Left Prime/Nordstrom support out per your note yesterday.\n\n📎 **HigherDOSE <> CRM Calendar Concepts** (gdoc, 0B) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gEGU3563QuaRxhUVGw59ckRrGTtbKs5qHkHXnwB_p2M/edit?tab=t.0)

- **2025-06-17 17:04** *User_2Z9G95* 💬 5 replies: Hi team — sharing a quick status update from our call today. Link to the agenda **[HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qW1zFK0lAJNgYV8BTtu4loP*bDVGL7l80a8V0IybvTg/edit?tab=t.0)**. High-level summary below:  
  
Account Health:  
The biggest thing I wanted to share with you is that we saw some funky things in the WoW data and after doing a deep dive noticed there was a huge influx in bot clicks this time last year, which is inflating last year's data (making it seem like this year is significantly down when it isn't!). No worries though, nothing is being impacted in our account right now, we just noticed that influx heavily skewed last year's metrics.  
  
*There is an action we can take in the account to remove bot clicks from our data — happy to chat through that more to see if we'd want to do that!*  
  
Flows:  
Flows are moving along — we have a handful [ready for review in the tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1csFoxkpwWmYtRuRfOE1QssDtjqMcmRm3wYaUGhYDnrg/edit?pli=1&amp;gid=1474997958#gid=1474997958).  
  
Campaigns:  
Elyse — if you get a chance to look at [July concepts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gEGU3563QuaRxhUVGw59ckRrGTtbKs5qHkHXnwB*p2M/edit?tab=t.0) this week that would be amazing!  
  
LMK if you have any questions. Have a great evening!\n\n*Reactions: :heart: User_5S72LT, Elyse*
    - **2025-06-17 18:34** *User_2Z9G95*: ↳ Hi @Elyse — Following up on this! There's a Post-Purchase Flow live that is triggering that message. The trigger is "made a purchase", so that's why they got it. Does this flow ring a bell to you? If not, I would recommend we turn it off.\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-17 at 4.34.04 PM.png** (png, 92.6KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F091R6H0LLW/screenshot_2025-06-17_at_4.34.04___pm.png)
- **2025-06-17 18:36** *Elyse*: So @User_2Z9G95 am I understanding this correctly - anyone who makes a purchase at all gets this?
- **2025-06-17 18:39** *User_2Z9G95*: Correct. It's slated to send 10 days after the purchase, so ideally the product has arrived by then, which shouldn't be an issue. But in this case it is. There's a few post-purchase flows live right now. Will take a look at them and see where we need to optimize.
- **2025-06-17 18:39** *Elyse*: Ahhhh ok got it
- **2025-06-17 18:40** *Elyse*: I wonder, is there no way on attentive (which note to self let’s check out on post script) to make the trigger more directly connected to a Shopify action (like tracking add/marked as fulfilled) vs just the general timeline of 10 days?
- **2025-06-17 18:41** *Elyse*: Thinking about orders that arrive sooner but also orders that are on back order or just generally take longer 
- **2025-06-17 18:42** *Elyse*: I mean there’s probably a very very rare scenario where someone gets an order more than ten days later that isn’t related to a back order or preorder 
- **2025-06-17 18:43** *Elyse*: But thinking about when people buy saunas too, that’s def a longer turnaround time than ten days
- **2025-06-17 18:43** *User_2Z9G95*: Yes! There are the same transactional triggers as in Klaviyo (order shipped, order delivered, out for delivery, etc.) — not sure why whoever set this one up did it that way, maybe there was a reason, but we will definitely update when we migrate.\n\n*Reactions: :+1::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

There's a script that looks something like this that needs to be removed. I think searching for attn in the theme.liquid will locate it!

- **2025-07-01 13:58** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse @Ingrid — Thank you so much for the time today as always! [Here's a link to the agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qW1zFK0lAJNgYV8BTtu4loP_bDVGL7l80a8V0IybvTg/edit?tab=t.0) for review. I added in an analysis of the unsubscribe rate. TLDR; The major daily spikes in follower loss fell on our heavy promotional days (MBS launch, Father's Day Flash) — no surprise there!  
  
While total unsubscribes increased compared to last year, list growth remains positive (we're bringing in more people than those who are leaving!):  
• Average daily unsubscribes: 144  
• Average daily new subscribers: 296  
    ◦ This shows a strong net growth, with the list expanding at nearly a 2:1 rate.  
And if we look at a average YoY comparison, it’s actually proportional to increased campaign volume and list size. As reach expands, higher unsubscribe rates are expected.  
• June 2024: 193 new subscribers per day, 104 unsubscribes per day  
• June 2025: 296 new subscribers per day, 144 unsubscribes per day  
In sum, there isn't anything alarming — we'll continue to monitor the declines MoM, but everything we're seeing is just a result of more promotional campaigns + an expanding list (which is good!).\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

- **2025-07-02 13:40** *User_2Z9G95*: @Elyse — RE the Klaviyo code exclusion update, it's all dependent on the collection the code is tied to. The collection it's tied to is called "Can be discounted" so I would assume bundles shouldn't be in there. I don't have access, but can you take a look at that collection and see if bundles are in there? It may be best to remove them, or I can select a different collection if there's a better one to use!

I see the bundles are live which is perfect.
- **2025-07-03 12:33** *User_2Z9G95*: Additionally, the other emails for next week's copy are ready for review! We'll want to get them into design ASAP since it's a short week!

- **2025-07-03 12:40** *Elyse*: Perfect will hop into these now
- **2025-07-03 13:19** *User_2Z9G95*: Thank you! Thinking we should probably schedule the email for 3p ET, but let me know if you feel otherwise!
- **2025-07-03 13:22** *User_2Z9G95*: We usually send to an engaged 90 day list, but for this one, we're recommending a send to a L60 engaged to see if a more targeted engaged list could help increase opens/clicks — plus this is a fun, engaging piece that will likely resonate most with our most engaged subscribers.  
  
I've also included a Tri-State area segment and excluded CAN/EU, given the Montauk inclusion, but if you feel like we should include them, let me know!
- **2025-07-03 13:43** *Elyse*: Yeah let’s do it re 3pm
- **2025-07-03 13:43** *Elyse*: Done waiting for them lol

- **2025-07-03 14:36** *Elyse*: and 2 lets try to differentiate the copy for hydration powder on the second bundle
- **2025-07-03 14:36** *Elyse*: the beginning and end of the sentence are almost identical to blurb about it in first bundle
- **2025-07-03 14:37** *Elyse*: also first design - second design features the blanket bag/blanket isn’t included in either bundle

[Here's a link to the initial postscript automations for review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19U*x-DHbtn7dNwNq7JL8xHdkMHOMkOAl8kY0G8o2Wjg/edit?tab=t.0). Let me know if you have any questions! @Ingrid — Feel free to review our weekly summary below + [agenda here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qW1zFK0lAJNgYV8BTtu4loP*bDVGL7l80a8V0IybvTg/edit?tab=t.0)!  
  
Shopify Summary:  
• This year MTD: 0.21% to goal with $30K in revenue   
• Last year MTD: 0.23% to goal with $27K in revenue  
Key Performance Insights:  
• Klaviyo-attributed campaign revenue is down 17% mainly because we've only sent two campaigns so far (two additional will be sent to help us round out the week)  
• Klaviyo-attributed flow revenue is up 53% YoY mainly attributed to our welcome and browse abandonment flows. We saw 150% more recipients receiving these flows which means more people are entering our funnel and are flows are converting them!   
    ◦ After speaking with the paid team, this increase in flow performance/sessions could be attributed to more customers coming in from the combo of AppLovin' and TikTok — adding more touch points into the customer journey.   
• We don't have any SMS-attributed revenue because we're still onboarding. We're hoping to be fully live by tomorrow EOD, so we can start generating revenue from our new campaigns and automations.   
Instant will be joining our next call on Tuesday, so we'll plan to start with an Instant summary at the beginning of that call (5-10 mins) prior to jumping into our weekly.\n\n📎 **HigherDOSE <> Sharma Brands CRM Agenda ** (gdoc, 0B) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qW1zFK0lAJNgYV8BTtu4loP_bDVGL7l80a8V0IybvTg/edit?tab=t.0)\n📎 **FOR REVIEW: Postscript Automations** (gdoc, 107.9KB) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19U_x-DHbtn7dNwNq7JL8xHdkMHOMkOAl8kY0G8o2Wjg/edit?tab=t.0)

- **2025-07-08 17:47** *User_2Z9G95*: Looks great! RE higherdose hacks, I think we can just have one CTA for each: [Shop Katie's Pick's], [Shop Jessica's Picks], [Shop Anastasia's Picks] and have each one link to the collections page. Thoughts?

- **2025-07-09 12:57** *Elyse* 💬 1 reply: left notes on postscript list - going to show ingrid in a few mins so may have more notes @User_2Z9G95
- **2025-07-09 14:56** *Elyse*: @User*2Z9G95 Ingrid and I just went through all the flows. Here are our notes:  
  
Big takeaway - the abandon series feels very generic/vague with subject lines and preview text. We’d love to run that whole series, plus welcome emails through the **[new product pillars doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TviOjzGtgGUhRuFDcaCLu3ePCtHVB0RDgFUrFvS1bhE/edit?usp=sharing)**. I just saw this for the first time today and think it’s spot on for language and where we want these flows to be. Here’s also the **[new manifesto doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w*C60nIHyiDn_VoDrXSXTJw46C6MyhGS-yrIZMw5AuI/edit?usp=sharing)** - it’s very much a working doc but is a great reference of the voice we want to be speaking in  
  
With replen flow - left notes on figma, but one note for the Shop By Goal design: we’d love to see which version performs better via email campaign. So want to think about where we can put that block into an appropriate email and test whether the lifestyle photo vs product photo does better with engagement and then implement that into the flows  
  
I’m setting up a call with Lauren to review design and everything as a whole for Monday/Tuesday so if we can somehow get outstanding copy polished up before then so I can present everything at once would be sick\n\n📎 **Unknown file** (gdoc, 0B)\n📎 **Unknown file** (gdoc, 0B)
- **2025-07-09 15:01** *Elyse*: Replen flows  
• glow serum email is underwhelming. want to swap out for better photos, and left notes for ingredient highlights  
• detox drops email looks good, want to swap the bottom shop by goal photos a bit so that its not beige beige beige blue  
• oxytocin oil email is missing ingredient breakdown and review highlight  
• highdration powder we loved the ingredient highlight design, and decided for the reviews we’d like to do a single review static image instead of the gif so its not too much to read while in reviews in motion  
    ◦ any emails that are still in copy, we picked which review we want on the doc
- **2025-07-09 15:12** *Elyse*: Same thing for Postscript automations copy - would love to toss that to Chandler and rework through new pillars/manifesto language @User_2Z9G95 I put some notes directly on the doc but want to revisit overall now having those two new docs
- **2025-07-09 15:15** *Elyse*: Diving in to wonderment and loyalty lion emails now
- **2025-07-09 15:31** *Elyse*: @User_2Z9G95 Loyalty Lion emails - would also love to run through those again with the new lens of the pillars/manifesto docs. They feel very generic loyalty, especially the subject lines. Want them to feel more elevated/high end/luxury brand, more exclusive, and more community nurturing if that makes sense
- **2025-07-09 15:33** *Elyse*: Subject line of “Score” is wildly off brand for HD, so must must must rework those
- **2025-07-09 15:42** *Elyse* 💬 1 reply: @User_2Z9G95 could you do me a favor please? Can you send me a test of the order shipped, out for delivery, and delivered emails as they are now please? Want to be able to compare
- **2025-07-09 15:46** *User_2Z9G95*: Thank you so much for this detailed feedback @Elyse! Will pass the Product Pillars and Manifesto doc around so that everyone has access to it for anything needed RE brand voice. This is super helpful!\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

Confirming we should exclude intl from the EMF one since fanny pack is US only? Should we also exclude from travel since we feature a lot fo US only products?

• Do you have any additional context in regards to the remaining [July concepts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WZsdfIu4Kan39TuUpV45mOOaxyasC-6B45nPEdCL_us/edit?tab=t.pgznx7hfmnnk)? We'd love to get copy finalized this week.   
• Would you like some support in regards to August concepts? Happy to start putting some ideas in if that would be helpful. We would love to have concepts finalized by early next week (at least the first half), so that we can start briefing those out.   
• I'll dive into your feedback on all flow-related items this afternoon!  
• Chandler is working on the Postscript copy today, so I'll let you know when that's ready for review.   
• 7/15 copy ready for review [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nPaex3squNKgDiXFixreJc2OS7hooZ5X4xjPbShxt3g/edit?tab=t.0)

- **2025-07-11 09:32** *Elyse*: @User_2Z9G95 just looked a postscript updated copy - moving in a better direction. so i do love the “lit up, deeply restored, and unapologetically radiant” i just think we shouldn’t say it back to back in like a handful of different texts. like imagine you’re a customer and get it in the welcome flow, then you abandon something you’re seeing that copy again, etc it feels redundant in a spot where we have opportunity to say something different each time  
@Ingrid do you have any thoughts here? [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LV6UztdwwUQGe99PbAWYZ4-NmgOf6Y3WDEyTgPTIKhQ/edit?tab=t.0) are the updates\n\n📎 **Unknown file** (gdoc, 0B)

- **2025-07-11 12:07** *User_2Z9G95* 💬 3 replies: Hi @Elyse! I just connected with Chandler and she's working through the flows today and early next week. Given that some of the emails need to be completely re-thought and re-done, we won't be able to have everything ready by Monday or Tuesday next week. Here's a summary of what we can do though:  
• By Monday EOD:  
    ◦ 7/21 campaign  
    ◦ 7/25 campaign  
    ◦ Replenishment flows  
    ◦ Abandoned Cart  
    ◦ Abandoned Checkout  
• By Tuesday EOD:  
    ◦ Abandoned Browse  
• By Wednesday EOD:  
    ◦ Wonderment flows  
    ◦ Loyalty Lion flows  
Given that the Welcome needs another re-write with the new TOV doc, we won't be able to have that done for early next week. We're moving to keep pushing these along as quickly as we can and appreciate your patience as we continue to work through these.  
  
We also had a few questions on some feedback left:  
• I saw you left a comment in [this Figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/tS7RlljzjfnN1HZZYe0l2L/HigherDOSE-%E2%80%93-Flows?node-id=33332-2180&amp;p=f&amp;t=AyOdrmbkH5d1DFMB-0) about providing copy. Is the plan just to condense that's already in there? Or what exactly needs to be modified? Thank you!  
• And for [this one](https://www.figma.com/design/tS7RlljzjfnN1HZZYe0l2L/HigherDOSE-%E2%80%93-Flows?node-id=39049-706&amp;t=E9aBNCdqOehg4OEI-0), do you have the one-liner about being fragrance-free/the scent we can add?  
I just realized I never sent you the tests for order update emails — so sorry! I actually can't send previews of transactional emails that are live, so I'll thread screenshots for you now, so you can review [those](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EkwlQlnlt16vUmyOQIjFMry4VW1bjBkJCvk1yUBuEqo/edit?tab=t.0)! Keep us posted on feedback there.  
  
One other outstanding item:  
1. We're waiting on some more context for the [Permission to Play](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WZsdfIu4Kan39TuUpV45mOOaxyasC-6B45nPEdCL_us/edit?tab=t.pgznx7hfmnnk) concepts for July.  
**One note from us:** Chandler will be OOO 7/21-7/25 and we're hoping to have the first week of August content in hand ASAP so she can get copy drafted for them. I see something about the Red Light Wrap Launch — if that's happening we need to have all context by early next week for us to work on the copy (+ we'd need to pause work on flows to accommodate that new product launch). Please let us know ASAP on that!

We're working to evolve our internal briefing process and were thinking we could also implement this to help streamline our approval process with you all, too! As you're building out August concepts, would you be able to integrate this framework for them so that we can ensure we're giving the team as much information upfront as possible? I know we don't always have access to the info this far in advance (totally fine), but the more info we can share the better! I'm also happy to support where needed — let me know your thoughts!

- **2025-07-15 11:54** *User_2Z9G95*: A/B test previews sent! Is there a data point in particular you're looking for with the A/B test? The "Finally here" one feels pretty promotional and doesn't give much context into what's inside the email (which is a really cool Q&amp;A). I'm wondering if the initial version that calls out Helen Leland is better to lean into here? Or maybe we can modify it slightly to A/B test leaning with the product in the subject versus leading with the narrative in the subject. Curious if calling out Q&amp;A directly drives stronger engagement, too, since we typically see those perform well!  
  
**Version A: Original**  
**Subject:** Finally here: The Microcurrent Body Sculptor  
**Preview:** Shipping is live — grab yours now  
  
**Version A: NEW**  
**Subject:** Now Shipping: The Microcurrent Body Sculptor  
**Preview:** + A Q&amp;A with Helen Leland  
  
**Version B:**   
**Subject:** The (new) summer body with Helen Leland

- **2025-07-16 12:19** *Chris Jacob*: Hi all can you advise on any key outbound email dates planned for the next week? We need to rollover the domain hosting which could cause a hiccup in this regard and we should probably also test a small outbound email once its setup new to make sure there's no issues
- **2025-07-16 12:23** *Elyse*: Nothing major major happening. Have emails scheduled for 7/18, 21 23 and 25 I believe
- **2025-07-16 12:23** *Elyse*: But all content/general product pushes no major initiatives
- **2025-07-16 14:07** *User_2Z9G95* 💬 1 reply: Hi @Chris Jacob — yes, we can definitely do that. Just building off what Elyse said, here's our email/SMS plan. Should we move anything around? Is there a day the rollover is happening? We can plan to not send any emails/SMS then.

I did send tomorrow's test emails for review (AB test SL/PT), but we can also review in the AM — PM sends have been working really well for us (again, will AB test when we have the chance), so it won't go out until a bit later!
- **2025-07-16 18:09** *Elyse*: @User_2Z9G95 both previews good to go
- **2025-07-17 13:42** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse + @Ingrid — I wanted to share some notes on a discount strategy for our abandoned flows. I've included what is live today and what we'd recommend changing below. Based on your feedback, I think we're all on the same page, but let us know if you have any other thoughts:  
  
• WELCOME10:  
    ◦ 10% off code that is live in Welcome Email #1, Site Abandonment Email #1, #2, and #3  
        ▪︎ We'd recommend including this in at least one other Welcome Email as well (last chance/driving urgency)  
        ▪︎ We'd recommend removing this from all Site Abandonment emails (top of funnel is focused on awareness/brand)  
• HIGHERSELF10:  
    ◦ 10% off code that is live in Abandoned Checkout Email #1 and Email #2  
    ◦ We'd recommend removing it from Abandoned Checkout email #1 and leaving it in just email #2.   
• FLASH10:  
    ◦ 10% off code that is live in Abandoned Browse Email #2, and Abandoned Cart Email #2  
    ◦ We'd recommend removing this from all Abandoned Browse emails (top of funnel is focused on awareness/brand)  
    ◦ We'd recommend leaving it in just Abandoned Cart email #2.   
I know we mentioned wanting to remove all FLASH messaging as well — if you'd like us to create a new code to put in the abandoned cart emails, let us know!  
  
All copy docs have been updated to reflect this strategy, but I just wanted to cover off on the updates we're making from the existing flows. Let us know if you have any questions!
- **2025-07-17 13:52** *Elyse*: Aligned on all of the above
- **2025-07-17 13:52** *Elyse*: @Ingrid confirm good by you?

- **2025-07-18 09:19** *Chris Jacob*: **<!channel>** we have begun domain hosting transfer this may cause interruptions in a variety of ways. If you face any tech issues at all please advise me here and if I don't respond to my personal email/phone as higherdose email could be interrupted

Now that we've launched Postscript, we're pacing closer to our goal. We're 58% through the month and we're 64% to our goal. We have a strong content marketing strategy planned for the rest of the month, so we're confident in maintaining momentum. We'll continue to monitor performance closely and optimize in real time to ensure we finish strong. We've made great progress on the email flows this week and are excited to hear Lauren's thoughts next week. Let us know if you have any questions. Enjoy the weekend!\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Sumish Khadka, :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

We're 70% through the month and 77% to our goal, so we're still pacing above and maintaining good momentum. We've driven $109K so far, so we're looking to drive $33K more. We have 6 more emails going out and 2 more SMS, so we should be in a good place.  
  
In regards to the flows, we went through all of the feedback and have put together this go-forward plan:  
• Hannah to build out templates of all 7 emails based on feedback  
• Hannah to send templates to Elyse for review/approval  
• Once approved, Elyse will get approval from Ingrid/Lauren/all stakeholders  
• Once approved, Hannah/Chandler will update copy over the next week + pass along to Elyse to review/approve with Ingrid/Lauren/all stakeholders  
• Once approved, Hannah will pass to design  
I'm hoping to have the templates done tomorrow, so you can have those ready to review and we can keep moving these along.\n\n📎 **HigherDOSE <> Sharma Brands CRM Agenda ** (gdoc, 0B) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qW1zFK0lAJNgYV8BTtu4loP_bDVGL7l80a8V0IybvTg/edit?tab=t.0)\n\n*Reactions: :1000: Elyse*

I’m reaching out with a bit of a bittersweet update — I’ll be leaving Sharma Brands as of Monday and moving on to a new chapter. I'm incredibly grateful to have learned so much about your company and to have started working with you on the revamp of your flows.  
  
The good news: you’re in amazing hands moving forward. I’m thrilled to introduce you to @User*2Z9G95, who will be taking over your account, working closely with @User*4PNMDE and has already been working on your audit behind the scenes. She’s an amazing email strategist, and I know you’re going to love working with her.  
  
The rest of the CRM and creative team — including our designers and copywriter — will remain the same, so you’re in excellent hands all around.  
  
We’re working closely behind the scenes to ensure a smooth and seamless transition, and I’ll be around to support during this handoff period as well.  
  
Thank you so much again — wishing you continued success, and I hope our paths cross again in the future.  
Best,  
Lisa Skaggs\n\n*Reactions: :heart-cinnamon: User_5S72LT, Elyse, User_CDDP51*

- **2025-04-18 11:24** *Elyse*: Hi @User_2Z9G95 happy Friday! We’re evaluating overall email performance YoY, and want to gain a better understanding of why email is the only channel thats down 40% YoY. Can you put together an analysis for us please? Ideally looking for opportunities for go forward growth, as well as analysis on the last year.
- **2025-04-18 11:25** *Elyse*: Also @User_2Z9G95 we should be meeting internally on Monday for May messaging, so will have some key content themes for you/for May email calendar by Tuesday.
- **2025-04-18 17:23** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse — thank you for letting us know! Absolutely. We'll put together some insights and a go-forward strategy for our call on Tuesday. A few clarifying questions:  
• Where are you finding these results? Given attribution differences across platforms, we want to better understand where you're pulling your numbers.   
• What's the exact timeframe you're looking at? Are you looking at year-to-date data? To clarify, you're seeing a 40% drop in performance from Jan - Apr 2025 compared to Jan - Apr 2024?   
As a side — we've built out the briefs for the [Welcome Flow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KwAEJZIfJ302SX-vD8Lp*RqwH24hTFey*5XqJP_zbqQ/edit?tab=t.0) and [Replenishment Flow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-iCIB6Cvc43jP1k-EAYnWvCXr4Ge0Jkl13ihjW1YnT8/edit?tab=t.0), which are ready for your review. This is a high-level summary of what we're briefing out to our copywriters, so if there's any specific call-outs or any specific narratives we should be sharing, please add comments directly into the document. Once drafted, we'll pass them back to you all for final review and then we'll brief them out to our designers.  
  
Next week, we'll dive into optimizations within your Site Abandonment, Cart Abandonment, and Browse Abandonment flows — which will then follow a similar process. [I've created this CRM Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1csFoxkpwWmYtRuRfOE1QssDtjqMcmRm3wYaUGhYDnrg/edit?gid=1474997958#gid=1474997958) that will keep track of everything we're working on: Flows, Campaigns, and SMS (including any tests we're running). Please feel free to reference this if you have any questions in regards to status updates (of course, you can always reach out, too!).  
  
We'll standby for the updated May messaging.  
  
Please let me know if you have any questions, thanks!\n\n📎 **HigherDOSE CRM | Welcome Flow Audit, V2** (gdoc, 155.4KB) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KwAEJZIfJ302SX-vD8Lp_RqwH24hTFey_5XqJP_zbqQ/edit?tab=t.0)\n📎 **HigherDose CRM Tracker** (gsheet, 0B) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1csFoxkpwWmYtRuRfOE1QssDtjqMcmRm3wYaUGhYDnrg/edit?gid=1474997958#gid=1474997958)\n\n*Reactions: :+1::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

Thank you!*  
  
We're also in the process of building out May's content calendar. I see that your other agency has content scheduled through April 30th — is that the last email they will have scheduled? Are there any campaign narratives in particular you're looking for us to support in May outside of the sale? We're still working through campaign idea recommendations, but here's a high-level schedule of what we're envisioning:\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-04-24 at 3.19.33 PM.png** (png, 135.8KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F08P60TGZV5/screenshot_2025-04-24_at_3.19.33_pm.png)

- **2025-04-28 13:06** *Elyse*: @User_2Z9G95 feedback on welcome flow copy from Lauren on our end:  
  
• Phrases like “grueling 9–5” and “life admin” feel a little cliché and casual. HigherDOSE typically feels more aspirational and less whiny about life’s stressors.  
• Some copy feels a bit basic (“Life is tiring. It’s never-ending.“) HigherDOSE usually sounds smarter, more energized, and more magnetic.  
• It’s missing a bit of that “sexy science” vibe — the feeling that you’re unlocking ancient wisdom and cutting-edge tech, and being seduced into self-care.  
• Good that they’re describing how you’ll feel but it could paint the sensory experience more! (HigherDOSE often invites you into a “felt” transformation!

We went the route of stronger narrative storytelling coupled with education. It's a much longer, denser version, but we're happy to go this route if the team would like.

- **2025-04-30 17:39** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse! Thanks so much for passing this along. Apologies for the delay, I wanted to do a deeper dive to see what I could find. We have a few thoughts to share: It turns out this customer is actually based in the UK — so they haven't been receiving any of the promotional messaging, they've only received campaigns and flows. It does look like this customer received two flow emails (Site and Browse) on the same day. To prevent this from happening in the future, we can add more specific profile filters (i.e. if customer is in X flow, prevent them from entering Y flow).  In addition, we also recommend turning on smart sending for all campaigns to help prevent this overlap. With Klaviyo's smart sending feature on — it prevents someone from receiving multiple emails within a 16 hour period. Because this wasn't in place, they've received all flow and campaign communication, which is likely what prompted them to reach out. We can also certainly create a preference page should people choose to customize their exclusions — we don't typically recommend relying solely on this — but with a strategic campaign segmentation strategy we should be able to prevent this from happening in the future!  
  
The good news: Klaviyo's unsubscribe rate is only up 7% L7 days over the previous 7 days, so the send rate isn't having too large of an impact on the rest of our community. In regards to long-term strategy implications — best practice is between 2-3 campaign sends per week, 4 can be pushing it, unless strategically segmented. We can put together a stronger segmentation strategy based what people viewed, previously ordered, etc. This is the strategy we recommend implementing moving forward. In regards to the campaigns themselves, given the feedback we've heard to date from you all, we're recommending a quality over quantity approach, where we'll be able to dive deeper into the stories, narratives, and data. We'll, of course, want to A/B test more longer-form content against shorter-form content to find what resonates most with our community, but regardless, we're excited about implementing this new longer-form, educational approach.  
  
I hope that helps provide some context! If there's anything else I can help clarify or dive deeper into, please let me know.\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Elyse*

- **2025-05-01 15:36** *User_2Z9G95*: @Elyse One note RE SMS — I saw that there's an existing EU audience, CA audience, and UK audience excluded — I assume this is intentional because of international fees? If so, I'll leave them excluded, unless otherwise noted!
- **2025-05-01 15:38** *Elyse*: So with international, we have them separated because some products don't ship there
- **2025-05-01 15:39** *Elyse* 💬 1 reply: So for example, anything really in a bundle is largely gonna be for USA. The only bundle that ships internationally is the Best Seller Bundle. Anything with body care, supplements in it doesn't ship internationally
- **2025-05-01 15:40** *Elyse* 💬 1 reply: Re these specific campaigns, I was under the impression that EU and Canada had the same Mother's Day as us and that it was just UK that had theirs in March
- **2025-05-01 15:42** *Elyse*: I just googled EU mother's day and it seems like it ranges from first/second sunday of may to last sunday of may. so I'm okay with leaving EU and Canada in for these MD campaigns
- **2025-05-01 15:43** *User_2Z9G95*: My thoughts exactly! We're on the same page :slightly*smiling*face:

Let me know if there's any thoughts/feedback (the last two paragraphs are new, so please review those!). Since this is still a text-based email, we have pretty limited control in terms of the background design, so we went with more of a beige/off-white background color to add some dimension.

- **2025-05-07 14:57** *Elyse*: one note - we say “might resonate” twice so thinking for bottom blurb:  
  
Even though I’m better able to prioritize self-care now, getting to this point wasn’t easy. I ignored so many warning signs until my body physically forced me to stop with a grand mal seizure. If you’re curious about my journey through motherhood, you can read my full blog post below.  
  
Happy Mother’s Day–to every woman discovering that choosing herself is not selfish, but one of the most powerful ways she can show up for the people she loves.

As next steps, we'll:  
• Look at top-performing evergreen campaigns from last year (+ continue building out the campaign calendar)  
• Provide a weekly reporting summary to keep track of YoY performance  
• Keep flows moving ASAP\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse, :raised_hands: Ingrid*
- **2025-05-13 18:04** *User_2Z9G95*: @Elyse — Just an FYI, outside of the promos, the following were the top revenue-driving campaigns from mid-May to mid-June last year — no surprise, most are red light hat related, so I think a takeaway here is to replicate some (or all) of these stories post MBS launch:  
• Infrared saunas vs. traditional saunas  
• Red light hat before and after (this would be good pre-Father's Day)  
• Red light hat customer feature (also good pre-Father's Day)  
• Red light FAQs  
• Frequency matters - Frequency FAQ\n\n*Reactions: :+1::skin-tone-3: Elyse*
- **2025-05-14 11:47** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse — Looking forward to our copy chat this afternoon! If the team is able to share (either live on the call or after) examples that really nail down the tone of voice that would be helpful. Having a visual/seeing the examples IRL makes it much easier for us to understand. If there's any old email examples, pages on your site, or blog posts we can dissect together that would be fabulous.\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse, :eyes: Elyse*

I think potentially a launch on paid of 5/22 was mentioned, but our formal recco is to move forward with 5/21 as a lot of the market is already on sale and the longer period will benefit the ad learnings! cc @Ari Murray @User*2Z9G95\n\n📎 **HigherDOSE MDW Plan** (gdoc, 0B) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HIM62VuEVzgaNKz0FClHa3v0Ckvmcg-4JlDRVh_MX00/edit?tab=t.0)\n\n*Reactions: :pray: Ari Murray*

When we switch to full launch, we'll just swap out the early access messaging in the subject line for email 1 and the early access messaging in the SMS copy.

You'll see we have a mix of engaged, unengaged, and lapsed customers:  
  
**Engaged:**  
• 365 days engaged (broadening to people who engaged all year — they're likely waiting for this sale period!)  
• Purchasers (All Time)  
• 180 days engaged, never purchased (Targeted + Broad - difference here depends on how many emails they've received from us; targeted means they received more emails, so they're slightly more engaged)  
• Clicked/opened at least once in the last 365 days, never bought  
**Unengaged:**  
• 180 days unengaged (don't want this to be too broad (365), so we can ensure we're reaching people who haven't engaged without sacrificing engagement too much)  
• Never purchased   
• Never engaged, subscribed 60+ days ago  
**Lapsed:**  
• VIPs - Purchased more than once, but not in the last 60 days  
• Was engaged 30-60 days ago, but not recently (have purchased at somepoint)  
• Purchased once at least 60 days ago, but hasn't opened or clicked in the last 90  
I'll be able to follow up with the re-send segmentation strategy tomorrow once we get some data, but it will likely be those who didn't open and/or didn't click + didn't purchase.  
  
We'll monitor performance and if we need to remove some of the broad unengaged segments, we certainly can! Will keep you posted.  
  
***Question: Any other exclusions we should be aware of? Is the Red Light Hat available abroad? I looked at the sheet you initially shared, but the row isn't filled out. I think that's the only product that's getting a spotlight.*** \n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-05-19 at 2.41.40 PM.png** (png, 176.1KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F08T56Q129G/screenshot_2025-05-19_at_2.41.40___pm.png)
- **2025-05-19 18:10** *User_2Z9G95*: **Plan for tomorrow:**  
• 10a ET - MDW pop-up goes live (QA + tested)  
• 10a ET - Lead Generation ads go-live  
• 12p ET - Early Access email + SMS gets sent  
• 7p-9p ET - Early Access email gets re-sent  
Please let us know if you have any questions! @Elyse — Once you confirm the segmentation strategy and the revised early access email I will get those scheduled.

Additionally — the site, browse, and cart abandonment flows we copied each have one campaign, however, to further target these high-intent purchasers, we're recommending adding an additional campaign to be sent 25 hours after the first initial send. We've gone ahead and copied existing flows to create these campaigns and @Elyse — I would love to send those through for review ASAP so we can get them live!  
  
Let me know if there's any thoughts/feedback on the above. Thank you all!\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-05-21 at 11.05.22 AM.png** (png, 104.8KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F08T6CH1JP5/screenshot_2025-05-21_at_11.05.22___am.png)\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Elyse*

5/23: SL: Your summer glow (on sale)  
5/24: SL: Supercharge your scalp health  
5/25: SL: Get dad what he wants for Father’s Day

- **2025-05-22 13:39** *User_2Z9G95*: Woohoo! And then we have two options for the plain text last chance email on 5/26 — I noticed that in the past HD sends an actual plain-text email, but our team also designed one. Sending through both for you to see which feels better! Alternatively, we can send on in the AM and one in the PM for a last min re-send opportunity.  
  
These are templates, not the campaigns so ignore the subject and preview for now.

- **2025-05-23 15:10** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse! CC: @Ingrid Letting you know everything for this weekend is scheduled and updated [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1csFoxkpwWmYtRuRfOE1QssDtjqMcmRm3wYaUGhYDnrg/edit?pli=1&gid=1474997958#gid=1474997958). We made a few tweaks to this weekend's segments. Since these emails are more product-focused and narrative in messaging, we tweaked the segments to be more engaged-driven. We removed any unengaged segments from this (which will ideally help drive click and open rate back up). We also included engaged, product-focused segments, focusing on those with higher-intent — see below:  
  
• Red Light Hat Spotlight: Added: Engaged L180, but never purchased Red Light Hat  
• PEMF Spotlight: Added: Engaged L180, but never purchased anything from the PEMF collection  
• Father's Day Gifting: Added: Engaged L180, but never purchased anything from the PEMF or Red Light collection  
I've included the full segment breakdown in the sheet if you want to see the others! Let us know if you have any thoughts, but we think targeting engaged segments for the weekend sends will put us in a great place engagement and conversion wise come Monday and Tuesday, when we're ready to double down on last minute/extended sale messaging to our initial broad audience.\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

I can ask Cory if they have any other brands that have seen success with that for inspo, but we'd likely include the evergreen 10% off with the coming soon messaging.

- **2025-05-29 12:56** *User_2Z9G95*: Noted on the 9a ET activation, however, we typically recommend email/SMS sends to be slightly later (1) to give us time to full activate/troubleshoot any issues (especially since pre-orders can be finicky) and (2) to not send it too early to allow people time to wake up and shop. Are you open to a 10a ET launch for both email and SMS?\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

- **2025-05-29 13:06** *User_2Z9G95*: @Elyse — RE join the waitlist strategy — can I ask the why behind this? Since we already have their emails, what are you looking to do with the information? Segment them and/or send the announcement to them early?  
  
I would maybe propose an SMS push, where we can get people to join SMS for early access. We can send the SMS at like 9:45am ET to give them a bit of a head start before email goes out?

- **2025-05-30 09:00** *User_2Z9G95*: Morning @Elyse — RE discount codes, I was connecting with a Klaviyo and Attentive rep to figure out the best way to go about generating the coupon codes for each platform. They both recommended we create a list of unique codes through Shopify and then upload that list to both Klaviyo and Attentive to pull from. We'd need to select "one use per customer” for the code settings to ensure people can only use one code (even if they get sent two (i.e. if they got one code from Attentive and one from Klaviyo)).  
  
Thoughts? This is likely the best way to ensure people can only use one code, while still leveraging both platforms.  
  
If so, here's what we'd need you to do in Shopify:  
**Go to:** Shopify Admin → **Discounts**  
Click **“Create Discount” → “Discount Code”**  
Choose:  
• Discount Type: e.g., **15% off**  
• Applies to: e.g., all products or your launch collection  
• Limit to one use per customer (highly recommended)  
Under **"Discount Code"**, choose:  
• **“Generate a batch of codes”**  
• Example format: `LAUNCH15-XXXX` (Shopify will auto-randomize)  
• Generate enough for both platforms (e.g., 10,000 codes)  
Save and export the codes as a **CSV**.  
  
From there, I can upload to both Klaviyo and Attentive and get the campaigns scheduled. Let me know what you think, so we can get this going! Thanks!

- **2025-05-30 15:07** *User_2Z9G95*: @Elyse UPDATE RE CODES:  
  
Attentive initially said that they could integrate them so that the same customer via email and SMS would get the same code (awesome!). Now it's sounding like there's a chance it won't work (we'll know shortly), but if it doesn't their recommendation is that the coupon code can only be provided via email *or* SMS.  
  
Since they aren't totally sure, our recommendation is to pivot to a singular Shopify code that doesn't stack with any other discount (i.e. SCULPT20) - that way we're ensuring its a cohesive experience between both CRM channels and SMS isn't left out because of this code consistency issue. Plus, we want this to be a success and it will only be activated for three days and it's product-specific so the risk of a leak is much lower, yet the risk on the customer is much higher if any of the unique ones are broken.  
  
Please let us know your thoughts on this ASAP and we'll update accordingly.

We have great data from MDW, so we're recommending we send to the same list as the engaged MDW segment that drove the strongest performance with some additions (VIPs, MDW purchasers, etc).

- **2025-06-02 07:49** *User_2Z9G95*: **One other thing we noticed, we wanted to get your thoughts on:**  
It looks like 29 email subscribers and 11 SMS subscribers already purchased the Ritual Body Sculptor Kit, prior to us officially launching via email and SMS. Since they bought full price without the promotion, I can foresee there being some complaints if they find out they can get it for 20% off (after having purchased it at full price).  
  
**Wanted to get your thoughts on two options for how to handle:**  
1. Exclude them from all MBS emails this week since they already purchased (we're going to exclude purchasers from ongoing emails regardless, but there's still a chance they could find out about the 20% off promotion, so we'd need a customer service plan in place to manage complaints if so)  
2. Include them in the MBS email messaging and have a customer service plan in place for people who reach out about purchasing the product prior to receiving the discount and wanting to get the 20% off on their purchase.  
Please let us know how to proceed with the segmenting of these customers!

I thought 3 days was the default, but I realized the brand I worked on previously had manually updated that. I just triple checked in our account and the default in Attentive, which is what we have is: 1 day view thru and 30 days click thru. As we onboard to Postscript we can figure out what theirs is and modify if we see fit.\n\n*Reactions: :+1::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

- **2025-06-03 15:54** *Ari Murray*: @Elyse our preferred stack is alia popup + postscript backend. we don't use the postscript popup when we have the option for alia as we've historically seen the best results with alia as popup and postscript behind it! cc @User_2Z9G95\n\n*Reactions: :+1::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

- **2025-06-04 12:31** *Elyse*: its the same as mdw basically, where its no code for the bundles but yes code for the solo tech
- **2025-06-04 12:31** *User_2Z9G95*: Ok, fab! Yep we will get this updated ASAP
- **2025-06-04 12:42** *User_2Z9G95*: @Elyse — I think the collections page with homepage CTA is a good idea! Let me know if you end up doing that, we would want to drive all emails to that page.
- **2025-06-04 12:43** *Elyse*: totally

- **2025-06-04 13:29** *Elyse*: I think we also have to be careful/mindful of our use of “pain relief” from legal perspective. Using that a lot in the father’s day stuff
- **2025-06-04 13:32** *User_2Z9G95*: Ok good shout! What has legal said specifically? Should we avoid it altogether? What can we say instead? Eases paid, eases sore muscles, etc.?
- **2025-06-04 13:32** *Elyse*: Just that its a bold/medical claim
- **2025-06-04 13:32** *Elyse*: so eases sore muscles, soothes tense muscles etc\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: User_2Z9G95*
- **2025-06-04 13:34** *Elyse*: things of that nature
- **2025-06-04 13:34** *Elyse*: like with MBS, people reported pain relief - we can’t say that, but talent can
- **2025-06-04 13:35** *Elyse*: so if influencer posts oh relieved pain in my sore xyz thats fine, but we can’t say will relieve xyz pain
- **2025-06-04 13:35** *Elyse*: so just wanna be mindful of our use there
- **2025-06-04 13:37** *Elyse*: I’d love if we could take a second spin through Father’s Day doc with that in mind @User_2Z9G95
- **2025-06-04 13:38** *Elyse*: I left a few notes on the doc, circulating to team now as well

- **2025-06-04 14:14** *Elyse*: also @User_2Z9G95 father’s day flash sale should be 48 hours instead of 24
- **2025-06-04 14:33** *Elyse*: @User_2Z9G95 just went through all the flows except welcome, will dive into that shortly. Left a bunch of notes but also circulated to the team so feel free to not make any adjustments yet til we get some more eyes on these\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: User_2Z9G95*

- **2025-06-05 09:25** *User_2Z9G95*: Thank you! As a side — I was going through the rest of the existing flows yesterday and wanted to get some clarity on additional ones we can update:  
1. All of the subscription related ones — how recently were those updated? Are you interested in a full redesign or just updating the footer?  
2. What is Reclaim? Are those flows still active and being used? They haven't triggered anything this year so I'm assuming not, but want to check! Safe to say we can disregard those?  
3. Loyalty Lion flows — how recently were those updated? Same note as subscription, we're happy to redesign!
- **2025-06-05 10:04** *Elyse*: All flows probably last updated within maybe a year or two. Could definitely use a full refresh across the board\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: User_2Z9G95*
- **2025-06-05 10:04** *Elyse*: I’d love your thoughts on the Loyalty Lion ones, if there’s anything we can be optimizing there
- **2025-06-05 11:08** *User_2Z9G95*: Perfect! This is super helpful context. We’ll keep prioritizing the pre purchase ones (cart, welcome, etc). and will get optimizations integrated for those, too!

- **2025-06-06 12:50** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse! Following up here with our finalized Father's Day Strategy. We recommend holding on the third SMS and segmenting the first one to ensure we're targeting those who are engaged first, and then broadening it (to avoid fatigue and overcommunication). Please let us know if you have any thoughts/questions.  
  
• Email 6/8:  
    ◦ Engaged segments (purchasers + non-purchasers)  
• MMS 6/8:  
    ◦ Engaged L365  
• Email 6/9:  
    ◦ Engaged segments (purchasers + non-purchasers), but exclude anyone who just purchased during the sale  
• SMS 6/9:  
    ◦ All subscribers, exclude purchasers  
• Email 6/9: [PM] Engaged segments (purchasers + non-purchasers), but exclude anyone who just purchased during the sale  
With that, these are the two SMS we recommend sending. Please let us know if you're aligned!\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-06 at 10.40.00 AM.png** (png, 261.4KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F09067TU96J/screenshot_2025-06-06_at_10.40.00___am.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-06 at 10.40.11 AM.png** (png, 88.8KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F090B135085/screenshot_2025-06-06_at_10.40.11___am.png)\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

- **2025-06-06 15:08** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Ingrid @Elyse — Happy Friday! Following up with the May CRM deep-dive. [Here's a link to our weekly agenda with May YoY performance and insights at the top](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qW1zFK0lAJNgYV8BTtu4loP*bDVGL7l80a8V0IybvTg/edit?tab=t.0), along with our [CRM Reporting Tracker with MoM totals](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtJOU2541YSnoXC7ccA-RRUy2E*ctEOXQUXO3AdPWU4/edit?gid=1153635090#gid=1153635090).  
  
**May YoY Summary:**  
TLDR; the biggest areas impacting May's performance are a lot of what we've already discussed. We aren't changing much with segmentation apart from broadening where it makes sense and in terms of traffic/recipient's receiving communications, it's all very in-line with last year's metrics. Regardless, here's what heavily impacted that performance:  
  
• Not having a new product launch (like last year)  
• Lower Mother's Day performance (consumers love a gift with purchase)  
• Flows (mainly abandoned checkout, abandoned browse, welcome flow)  
• Broadened campaign segmentation strategy impacted click rates, but allowed us to reach more people and drive significant growth for MDW  
In addition to getting new flow content live ASAP, as an immediate next step, we're going to take a deeper look and how each flow is set up to make sure they're firing correctly. We will keep you posted on findings here!  
  
**On the upside, SMS drove a 100% increase YoY**, so we're going to continue to double down on driving growth and engagement through this channel. If we look at this year's total performance, **May was our strongest month (for both email and SMS), with the lowest declines to date (just 10%).**  
  
**June MTD Summary:**  
**From Shopify — I'm also happy to report that we've sold 758 Body Sculptor Ritual Sets so far, generating $249,711.02 in net sales. We've already driven $111,080.83 from Klaviyo and $86,029.15 from Attentive. Together, we're already 65% towards our CRM revenue goal for June — let's keep it up!**  
  
I hope this information is helpful — as always, please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions!\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

- **2025-06-11 16:44** *User_2Z9G95*: Perfect! Confirming this has been scheduled to our 90 days engaged segment. Confirming we've also added a send time A/B test. Looking at L365 on Shopify, we see the most orders/sessions come in between 12p-2p ET and 8p-10p ET. So we've added the test for 12p vs. 8p ET to see if there's any statistically significant differences.\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*
- **2025-06-11 18:48** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse — thanks for your patience here. Please see high-level data and reccos below.  
  
**Summary:**  
TLDR; given our growth goals and what we want to achieve this year, we feel that Alia and Instant would be great integrations to help get us there. Together, both of these will help us better understand our customer journey because we'll have the high-converting pop-up (converting even more new users to subscribers) coupled with engaging flows capturing anonymous users. Both will help expand our lists and get new subscribers further down the funnel (with targeted messaging). Plus, they're both month-to-month, so there's no long-term contracts involved, and are reasonably priced within the market. Plus they have great customer support teams we greatly trust!  
  
**Instant Audiences:**  
I don't have access to Instant's full dashboard (I'm sure we'll get some insight tomorrow), but according to Klaviyo (L30 days), these are the Instant Audience Flows that generated the most revenue:  
• $27,223.08 in additional Klaviyo revenue from their Abandoned Checkout Flow (didn't outperform the regular Abandoned Checkout Flow ($53K), but still contributed incremental revenue)  
• $20,789.18 in additional Klaviyo revenue from their MDW Sale Abandoned Checkout Flow (didn't outperform the regular MDW Sale Abandoned Checkout Flow ($41K), but still contributed incremental revenue)  
• $10,901.45 in additional Klaviyo revenue from their MDW Sale Abandoned Cart Flow (outperformed the regular MDW Sale Abandoned Cart Flow ($8K))  
• $7,729.69 in additional Klaviyo revenue from their Browse Abandonment Flow ((didn't outperform the regular Abandoned Checkout Flow ($30K), but still contributed incremental revenue)  
We're seeing the greatest success from the checkout and cart abandonment flow (which makes sense as this is the furthest down the funnel), but we're eager to get Instant Audience Flows integrated with our new Abandonment Flows that are being designed.  
  
**Alia:**  
For Alia (L30 days), we're seeing:  
• 6.36% email sign up rate  
• 4.62% SMS sign up rate  
In Klaviyo specifically, we hav:  
• 2,373 customers tagged with beauty & skincare  
• 1,961 customers tagged with detox & cleanse  
• 1,569 customers tagged with recovery & muscle relief  
• 1,161 customers tagged with relaxation & stress relief  
• and in total we've captured 10,206 new subscribers from Alia-specific pop-ups  
In Attentive specifically, we have:  
• 779 customers tagged with beauty & skincare  
• 621 customers tagged with detox & cleanse  
• 472 customers tagged with recovery & muscle relief  
• 331 customers tagged with relaxation & stress relief  
• and in total, we've captured 2,757 new subscribers from the Alia-specific pop-ups  
From our previous evergreen Attentive pop-up, we saw about 3%-4% opt-in for email and a 1%-2% opt-in for SMS, so we're definitely seeing improvements with Alia. If there's a concern around how often it's triggering, let's tell the team we want it to only show to new visitors or exclude those who sign up — we have a lot of control in terms of how we want the pop-ups to look/function and Alia gives us a dedicated contact to work through that with us (which is definitely one of the perks!). Having Alia's strong functionality coupled with our new, more personalized welcome flow will also provide an ever better brand intro and customer journey.

- **2025-06-17 17:04** *User_2Z9G95* 💬 5 replies: Hi team — sharing a quick status update from our call today. Link to the agenda **[HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qW1zFK0lAJNgYV8BTtu4loP*bDVGL7l80a8V0IybvTg/edit?tab=t.0)**. High-level summary below:  
  
Account Health:  
The biggest thing I wanted to share with you is that we saw some funky things in the WoW data and after doing a deep dive noticed there was a huge influx in bot clicks this time last year, which is inflating last year's data (making it seem like this year is significantly down when it isn't!). No worries though, nothing is being impacted in our account right now, we just noticed that influx heavily skewed last year's metrics.  
  
*There is an action we can take in the account to remove bot clicks from our data — happy to chat through that more to see if we'd want to do that!*  
  
Flows:  
Flows are moving along — we have a handful [ready for review in the tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1csFoxkpwWmYtRuRfOE1QssDtjqMcmRm3wYaUGhYDnrg/edit?pli=1&amp;gid=1474997958#gid=1474997958).  
  
Campaigns:  
Elyse — if you get a chance to look at [July concepts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gEGU3563QuaRxhUVGw59ckRrGTtbKs5qHkHXnwB*p2M/edit?tab=t.0) this week that would be amazing!  
  
LMK if you have any questions. Have a great evening!\n\n*Reactions: :heart: User_5S72LT, Elyse*
    - **2025-06-17 18:34** *User_2Z9G95*: ↳ Hi @Elyse — Following up on this! There's a Post-Purchase Flow live that is triggering that message. The trigger is "made a purchase", so that's why they got it. Does this flow ring a bell to you? If not, I would recommend we turn it off.\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-17 at 4.34.04 PM.png** (png, 92.6KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F091R6H0LLW/screenshot_2025-06-17_at_4.34.04___pm.png)
- **2025-06-17 18:36** *Elyse*: So @User_2Z9G95 am I understanding this correctly - anyone who makes a purchase at all gets this?
- **2025-06-17 18:39** *User_2Z9G95*: Correct. It's slated to send 10 days after the purchase, so ideally the product has arrived by then, which shouldn't be an issue. But in this case it is. There's a few post-purchase flows live right now. Will take a look at them and see where we need to optimize.
- **2025-06-17 18:39** *Elyse*: Ahhhh ok got it
- **2025-06-17 18:40** *Elyse*: I wonder, is there no way on attentive (which note to self let’s check out on post script) to make the trigger more directly connected to a Shopify action (like tracking add/marked as fulfilled) vs just the general timeline of 10 days?
- **2025-06-17 18:41** *Elyse*: Thinking about orders that arrive sooner but also orders that are on back order or just generally take longer 
- **2025-06-17 18:42** *Elyse*: I mean there’s probably a very very rare scenario where someone gets an order more than ten days later that isn’t related to a back order or preorder 
- **2025-06-17 18:43** *Elyse*: But thinking about when people buy saunas too, that’s def a longer turnaround time than ten days
- **2025-06-17 18:43** *User_2Z9G95*: Yes! There are the same transactional triggers as in Klaviyo (order shipped, order delivered, out for delivery, etc.) — not sure why whoever set this one up did it that way, maybe there was a reason, but we will definitely update when we migrate.\n\n*Reactions: :+1::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

- **2025-07-01 09:49** *User_2Z9G95*: Yes! So the tag needs to be removed from the theme's code. I don't have access to do that, but is there someone on your team who handles dev? There's a script that looks something like this that needs to be removed. I think searching for attn in the theme.liquid will locate it!

- **2025-07-01 13:58** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse @Ingrid — Thank you so much for the time today as always! [Here's a link to the agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qW1zFK0lAJNgYV8BTtu4loP_bDVGL7l80a8V0IybvTg/edit?tab=t.0) for review. I added in an analysis of the unsubscribe rate. TLDR; The major daily spikes in follower loss fell on our heavy promotional days (MBS launch, Father's Day Flash) — no surprise there!  
  
While total unsubscribes increased compared to last year, list growth remains positive (we're bringing in more people than those who are leaving!):  
• Average daily unsubscribes: 144  
• Average daily new subscribers: 296  
    ◦ This shows a strong net growth, with the list expanding at nearly a 2:1 rate.  
And if we look at a average YoY comparison, it’s actually proportional to increased campaign volume and list size. As reach expands, higher unsubscribe rates are expected.  
• June 2024: 193 new subscribers per day, 104 unsubscribes per day  
• June 2025: 296 new subscribers per day, 144 unsubscribes per day  
In sum, there isn't anything alarming — we'll continue to monitor the declines MoM, but everything we're seeing is just a result of more promotional campaigns + an expanding list (which is good!).\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

- **2025-07-02 13:40** *User_2Z9G95*: @Elyse — RE the Klaviyo code exclusion update, it's all dependent on the collection the code is tied to. The collection it's tied to is called "Can be discounted" so I would assume bundles shouldn't be in there. I don't have access, but can you take a look at that collection and see if bundles are in there? It may be best to remove them, or I can select a different collection if there's a better one to use!

I've also included a Tri-State area segment and excluded CAN/EU, given the Montauk inclusion, but if you feel like we should include them, let me know!

- **2025-07-08 12:58** *Elyse*: @User_2Z9G95 would hold on design for 7/9. see my notes on the google doc please!
- **2025-07-08 14:25** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse — Thanks so much for the time today! [Here's a link to the initial postscript automations for review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19U*x-DHbtn7dNwNq7JL8xHdkMHOMkOAl8kY0G8o2Wjg/edit?tab=t.0). Let me know if you have any questions! @Ingrid — Feel free to review our weekly summary below + [agenda here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qW1zFK0lAJNgYV8BTtu4loP*bDVGL7l80a8V0IybvTg/edit?tab=t.0)!  
  
Shopify Summary:  
• This year MTD: 0.21% to goal with $30K in revenue   
• Last year MTD: 0.23% to goal with $27K in revenue  
Key Performance Insights:  
• Klaviyo-attributed campaign revenue is down 17% mainly because we've only sent two campaigns so far (two additional will be sent to help us round out the week)  
• Klaviyo-attributed flow revenue is up 53% YoY mainly attributed to our welcome and browse abandonment flows. We saw 150% more recipients receiving these flows which means more people are entering our funnel and are flows are converting them!   
    ◦ After speaking with the paid team, this increase in flow performance/sessions could be attributed to more customers coming in from the combo of AppLovin' and TikTok — adding more touch points into the customer journey.   
• We don't have any SMS-attributed revenue because we're still onboarding. We're hoping to be fully live by tomorrow EOD, so we can start generating revenue from our new campaigns and automations.   
Instant will be joining our next call on Tuesday, so we'll plan to start with an Instant summary at the beginning of that call (5-10 mins) prior to jumping into our weekly.\n\n📎 **HigherDOSE <> Sharma Brands CRM Agenda ** (gdoc, 0B) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qW1zFK0lAJNgYV8BTtu4loP_bDVGL7l80a8V0IybvTg/edit?tab=t.0)\n📎 **FOR REVIEW: Postscript Automations** (gdoc, 107.9KB) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19U_x-DHbtn7dNwNq7JL8xHdkMHOMkOAl8kY0G8o2Wjg/edit?tab=t.0)

- **2025-07-08 17:47** *User_2Z9G95*: Looks great! RE higherdose hacks, I think we can just have one CTA for each: [Shop Katie's Pick's], [Shop Jessica's Picks], [Shop Anastasia's Picks] and have each one link to the collections page. Thoughts?

- **2025-07-09 12:57** *Elyse* 💬 1 reply: left notes on postscript list - going to show ingrid in a few mins so may have more notes @User_2Z9G95
- **2025-07-09 14:56** *Elyse*: @User*2Z9G95 Ingrid and I just went through all the flows. Here are our notes:  
  
Big takeaway - the abandon series feels very generic/vague with subject lines and preview text. We’d love to run that whole series, plus welcome emails through the **[new product pillars doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TviOjzGtgGUhRuFDcaCLu3ePCtHVB0RDgFUrFvS1bhE/edit?usp=sharing)**. I just saw this for the first time today and think it’s spot on for language and where we want these flows to be. Here’s also the **[new manifesto doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w*C60nIHyiDn_VoDrXSXTJw46C6MyhGS-yrIZMw5AuI/edit?usp=sharing)** - it’s very much a working doc but is a great reference of the voice we want to be speaking in  
  
With replen flow - left notes on figma, but one note for the Shop By Goal design: we’d love to see which version performs better via email campaign. So want to think about where we can put that block into an appropriate email and test whether the lifestyle photo vs product photo does better with engagement and then implement that into the flows  
  
I’m setting up a call with Lauren to review design and everything as a whole for Monday/Tuesday so if we can somehow get outstanding copy polished up before then so I can present everything at once would be sick\n\n📎 **Unknown file** (gdoc, 0B)\n📎 **Unknown file** (gdoc, 0B)
- **2025-07-09 15:01** *Elyse*: Replen flows  
• glow serum email is underwhelming. want to swap out for better photos, and left notes for ingredient highlights  
• detox drops email looks good, want to swap the bottom shop by goal photos a bit so that its not beige beige beige blue  
• oxytocin oil email is missing ingredient breakdown and review highlight  
• highdration powder we loved the ingredient highlight design, and decided for the reviews we’d like to do a single review static image instead of the gif so its not too much to read while in reviews in motion  
    ◦ any emails that are still in copy, we picked which review we want on the doc
- **2025-07-09 15:12** *Elyse*: Same thing for Postscript automations copy - would love to toss that to Chandler and rework through new pillars/manifesto language @User_2Z9G95 I put some notes directly on the doc but want to revisit overall now having those two new docs
- **2025-07-09 15:15** *Elyse*: Diving in to wonderment and loyalty lion emails now
- **2025-07-09 15:31** *Elyse*: @User_2Z9G95 Loyalty Lion emails - would also love to run through those again with the new lens of the pillars/manifesto docs. They feel very generic loyalty, especially the subject lines. Want them to feel more elevated/high end/luxury brand, more exclusive, and more community nurturing if that makes sense
- **2025-07-09 15:33** *Elyse*: Subject line of “Score” is wildly off brand for HD, so must must must rework those
- **2025-07-09 15:42** *Elyse* 💬 1 reply: @User_2Z9G95 could you do me a favor please? Can you send me a test of the order shipped, out for delivery, and delivered emails as they are now please? Want to be able to compare
- **2025-07-09 15:46** *User_2Z9G95*: Thank you so much for this detailed feedback @Elyse! Will pass the Product Pillars and Manifesto doc around so that everyone has access to it for anything needed RE brand voice. This is super helpful!\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

Confirming we should exclude intl from the EMF one since fanny pack is US only? Should we also exclude from travel since we feature a lot fo US only products?

• Do you have any additional context in regards to the remaining [July concepts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WZsdfIu4Kan39TuUpV45mOOaxyasC-6B45nPEdCL_us/edit?tab=t.pgznx7hfmnnk)? We'd love to get copy finalized this week.   
• Would you like some support in regards to August concepts? Happy to start putting some ideas in if that would be helpful. We would love to have concepts finalized by early next week (at least the first half), so that we can start briefing those out.   
• I'll dive into your feedback on all flow-related items this afternoon!  
• Chandler is working on the Postscript copy today, so I'll let you know when that's ready for review.

- **2025-07-11 09:32** *Elyse*: @User_2Z9G95 just looked a postscript updated copy - moving in a better direction. so i do love the “lit up, deeply restored, and unapologetically radiant” i just think we shouldn’t say it back to back in like a handful of different texts. like imagine you’re a customer and get it in the welcome flow, then you abandon something you’re seeing that copy again, etc it feels redundant in a spot where we have opportunity to say something different each time  
@Ingrid do you have any thoughts here? [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LV6UztdwwUQGe99PbAWYZ4-NmgOf6Y3WDEyTgPTIKhQ/edit?tab=t.0) are the updates\n\n📎 **Unknown file** (gdoc, 0B)

- **2025-07-11 12:07** *User_2Z9G95* 💬 3 replies: Hi @Elyse! I just connected with Chandler and she's working through the flows today and early next week. Given that some of the emails need to be completely re-thought and re-done, we won't be able to have everything ready by Monday or Tuesday next week. Here's a summary of what we can do though:  
• By Monday EOD:  
    ◦ 7/21 campaign  
    ◦ 7/25 campaign  
    ◦ Replenishment flows  
    ◦ Abandoned Cart  
    ◦ Abandoned Checkout  
• By Tuesday EOD:  
    ◦ Abandoned Browse  
• By Wednesday EOD:  
    ◦ Wonderment flows  
    ◦ Loyalty Lion flows  
Given that the Welcome needs another re-write with the new TOV doc, we won't be able to have that done for early next week. We're moving to keep pushing these along as quickly as we can and appreciate your patience as we continue to work through these.  
  
We also had a few questions on some feedback left:  
• I saw you left a comment in [this Figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/tS7RlljzjfnN1HZZYe0l2L/HigherDOSE-%E2%80%93-Flows?node-id=33332-2180&amp;p=f&amp;t=AyOdrmbkH5d1DFMB-0) about providing copy. Is the plan just to condense that's already in there? Or what exactly needs to be modified? Thank you!  
• And for [this one](https://www.figma.com/design/tS7RlljzjfnN1HZZYe0l2L/HigherDOSE-%E2%80%93-Flows?node-id=39049-706&amp;t=E9aBNCdqOehg4OEI-0), do you have the one-liner about being fragrance-free/the scent we can add?  
I just realized I never sent you the tests for order update emails — so sorry! I actually can't send previews of transactional emails that are live, so I'll thread screenshots for you now, so you can review [those](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EkwlQlnlt16vUmyOQIjFMry4VW1bjBkJCvk1yUBuEqo/edit?tab=t.0)! Keep us posted on feedback there.  
  
One other outstanding item:  
1. We're waiting on some more context for the [Permission to Play](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WZsdfIu4Kan39TuUpV45mOOaxyasC-6B45nPEdCL_us/edit?tab=t.pgznx7hfmnnk) concepts for July.  
**One note from us:** Chandler will be OOO 7/21-7/25 and we're hoping to have the first week of August content in hand ASAP so she can get copy drafted for them. I see something about the Red Light Wrap Launch — if that's happening we need to have all context by early next week for us to work on the copy (+ we'd need to pause work on flows to accommodate that new product launch). Please let us know ASAP on that!

- **2025-07-14 14:00** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse ! We're working to evolve our internal briefing process and were thinking we could also implement this to help streamline our approval process with you all, too! As you're building out August concepts, would you be able to integrate this framework for them so that we can ensure we're giving the team as much information upfront as possible? I know we don't always have access to the info this far in advance (totally fine), but the more info we can share the better! I'm also happy to support where needed — let me know your thoughts!  
  
• Campaign overview:  
• Goal of the email:  
• Products to feature:  
• If this campaign has multiple themes or blocks (i.e. a blog and a product feature), what is the hierarchy of messaging?  
• If additional research is needed from our team, please link any helpful resources (or let us know where we should be diving deeper):  
• Do you need to source any additional information internally before we get started?  
• CTAs:

- **2025-07-15 11:34** *User_2Z9G95*: Today's preview coming shortly @Elyse!
- **2025-07-15 11:54** *User_2Z9G95*: A/B test previews sent! Is there a data point in particular you're looking for with the A/B test? The "Finally here" one feels pretty promotional and doesn't give much context into what's inside the email (which is a really cool Q&amp;A). I'm wondering if the initial version that calls out Helen Leland is better to lean into here? Or maybe we can modify it slightly to A/B test leaning with the product in the subject versus leading with the narrative in the subject. Curious if calling out Q&amp;A directly drives stronger engagement, too, since we typically see those perform well!  
  
**Version A: Original**  
**Subject:** Finally here: The Microcurrent Body Sculptor  
**Preview:** Shipping is live — grab yours now  
  
**Version A: NEW**  
**Subject:** Now Shipping: The Microcurrent Body Sculptor  
**Preview:** + A Q&amp;A with Helen Leland  
  
**Version B:**   
**Subject:** The (new) summer body with Helen Leland  
**Preview:** Activate your postural muscles with the Microcurrent Body Sculptor  
  
This is what we had for the Father's Day Q&amp;A, that drove a really high open rate.  
Subject: Dads who DOSE: Meet David  
Preview text: A Father’s Day Q&amp;A

I did send tomorrow's test emails for review (AB test SL/PT), but we can also review in the AM — PM sends have been working really well for us (again, will AB test when we have the chance), so it won't go out until a bit later!
- **2025-07-16 18:09** *Elyse*: @User_2Z9G95 both previews good to go
- **2025-07-17 13:42** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse + @Ingrid — I wanted to share some notes on a discount strategy for our abandoned flows. I've included what is live today and what we'd recommend changing below. Based on your feedback, I think we're all on the same page, but let us know if you have any other thoughts:  
  
• WELCOME10:  
    ◦ 10% off code that is live in Welcome Email #1, Site Abandonment Email #1, #2, and #3  
        ▪︎ We'd recommend including this in at least one other Welcome Email as well (last chance/driving urgency)  
        ▪︎ We'd recommend removing this from all Site Abandonment emails (top of funnel is focused on awareness/brand)  
• HIGHERSELF10:  
    ◦ 10% off code that is live in Abandoned Checkout Email #1 and Email #2  
    ◦ We'd recommend removing it from Abandoned Checkout email #1 and leaving it in just email #2.   
• FLASH10:  
    ◦ 10% off code that is live in Abandoned Browse Email #2, and Abandoned Cart Email #2  
    ◦ We'd recommend removing this from all Abandoned Browse emails (top of funnel is focused on awareness/brand)  
    ◦ We'd recommend leaving it in just Abandoned Cart email #2.   
I know we mentioned wanting to remove all FLASH messaging as well — if you'd like us to create a new code to put in the abandoned cart emails, let us know!  
  
All copy docs have been updated to reflect this strategy, but I just wanted to cover off on the updates we're making from the existing flows. Let us know if you have any questions!
- **2025-07-17 13:52** *Elyse*: Aligned on all of the above

Now that we've launched Postscript, we're pacing closer to our goal. We're 58% through the month and we're 64% to our goal. We have a strong content marketing strategy planned for the rest of the month, so we're confident in maintaining momentum. We'll continue to monitor performance closely and optimize in real time to ensure we finish strong. We've made great progress on the email flows this week and are excited to hear Lauren's thoughts next week. Let us know if you have any questions. Enjoy the weekend!\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Sumish Khadka, :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

- **2025-07-22 18:51** *User_2Z9G95*: Hey team! Sorry for the delay — [here's a link to the agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qW1zFK0lAJNgYV8BTtu4loP_bDVGL7l80a8V0IybvTg/edit?tab=t.0) we reviewed today and a high-level summary below:  
  
We're 70% through the month and 77% to our goal, so we're still pacing above and maintaining good momentum. We've driven $109K so far, so we're looking to drive $33K more. We have 6 more emails going out and 2 more SMS, so we should be in a good place.  
  
In regards to the flows, we went through all of the feedback and have put together this go-forward plan:  
• Hannah to build out templates of all 7 emails based on feedback  
• Hannah to send templates to Elyse for review/approval  
• Once approved, Elyse will get approval from Ingrid/Lauren/all stakeholders  
• Once approved, Hannah/Chandler will update copy over the next week + pass along to Elyse to review/approve with Ingrid/Lauren/all stakeholders  
• Once approved, Hannah will pass to design  
I'm hoping to have the templates done tomorrow, so you can have those ready to review and we can keep moving these along.\n\n📎 **HigherDOSE <> Sharma Brands CRM Agenda ** (gdoc, 0B) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qW1zFK0lAJNgYV8BTtu4loP_bDVGL7l80a8V0IybvTg/edit?tab=t.0)\n\n*Reactions: :1000: Elyse*

I’m reaching out with a bit of a bittersweet update — I’ll be leaving Sharma Brands as of Monday and moving on to a new chapter. I'm incredibly grateful to have learned so much about your company and to have started working with you on the revamp of your flows.  
  
The good news: you’re in amazing hands moving forward. I’m thrilled to introduce you to @User*2Z9G95, who will be taking over your account, working closely with @User*4PNMDE and has already been working on your audit behind the scenes. She’s an amazing email strategist, and I know you’re going to love working with her.  
  
The rest of the CRM and creative team — including our designers and copywriter — will remain the same, so you’re in excellent hands all around.  
  
We’re working closely behind the scenes to ensure a smooth and seamless transition, and I’ll be around to support during this handoff period as well.  
  
Thank you so much again — wishing you continued success, and I hope our paths cross again in the future.  
Best,  
Lisa Skaggs\n\n*Reactions: :heart-cinnamon: User_5S72LT, Elyse, User_CDDP51*

- **2025-04-18 11:24** *Elyse*: Hi @User_2Z9G95 happy Friday! We’re evaluating overall email performance YoY, and want to gain a better understanding of why email is the only channel thats down 40% YoY. Can you put together an analysis for us please? Ideally looking for opportunities for go forward growth, as well as analysis on the last year.
- **2025-04-18 11:25** *Elyse*: Also @User_2Z9G95 we should be meeting internally on Monday for May messaging, so will have some key content themes for you/for May email calendar by Tuesday.
- **2025-04-18 17:23** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse — thank you for letting us know! Absolutely. We'll put together some insights and a go-forward strategy for our call on Tuesday. A few clarifying questions:  
• Where are you finding these results? Given attribution differences across platforms, we want to better understand where you're pulling your numbers.   
• What's the exact timeframe you're looking at? Are you looking at year-to-date data? To clarify, you're seeing a 40% drop in performance from Jan - Apr 2025 compared to Jan - Apr 2024?   
As a side — we've built out the briefs for the [Welcome Flow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KwAEJZIfJ302SX-vD8Lp*RqwH24hTFey*5XqJP_zbqQ/edit?tab=t.0) and [Replenishment Flow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-iCIB6Cvc43jP1k-EAYnWvCXr4Ge0Jkl13ihjW1YnT8/edit?tab=t.0), which are ready for your review. This is a high-level summary of what we're briefing out to our copywriters, so if there's any specific call-outs or any specific narratives we should be sharing, please add comments directly into the document. Once drafted, we'll pass them back to you all for final review and then we'll brief them out to our designers.  
  
Next week, we'll dive into optimizations within your Site Abandonment, Cart Abandonment, and Browse Abandonment flows — which will then follow a similar process. [I've created this CRM Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1csFoxkpwWmYtRuRfOE1QssDtjqMcmRm3wYaUGhYDnrg/edit?gid=1474997958#gid=1474997958) that will keep track of everything we're working on: Flows, Campaigns, and SMS (including any tests we're running). Please feel free to reference this if you have any questions in regards to status updates (of course, you can always reach out, too!).  
  
We'll standby for the updated May messaging.

    ◦ Bundles will go back down to 20% off, no code necessary  
    ◦ Goal here is more around “self-gifting”, gift cards  
• Memorial Day weekend 5/22 - 5/26  
    ◦ 20% off sitewide, code tbd will circle back when I have it  
    ◦ 5/22 will be VIP early access, but this will likely mean access to email/sms subscribers only

- **2025-04-28 13:06** *Elyse*: @User_2Z9G95 feedback on welcome flow copy from Lauren on our end:  
  
• Phrases like “grueling 9–5” and “life admin” feel a little cliché and casual. HigherDOSE typically feels more aspirational and less whiny about life’s stressors.  
• Some copy feels a bit basic (“Life is tiring. It’s never-ending.“) HigherDOSE usually sounds smarter, more energized, and more magnetic.  
• It’s missing a bit of that “sexy science” vibe — the feeling that you’re unlocking ancient wisdom and cutting-edge tech, and being seduced into self-care.  
• Good that they’re describing how you’ll feel but it could paint the sensory experience more! (HigherDOSE often invites you into a “felt” transformation!

- **2025-04-30 17:39** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse! Thanks so much for passing this along. Apologies for the delay, I wanted to do a deeper dive to see what I could find. We have a few thoughts to share: It turns out this customer is actually based in the UK — so they haven't been receiving any of the promotional messaging, they've only received campaigns and flows. It does look like this customer received two flow emails (Site and Browse) on the same day. To prevent this from happening in the future, we can add more specific profile filters (i.e. if customer is in X flow, prevent them from entering Y flow).  In addition, we also recommend turning on smart sending for all campaigns to help prevent this overlap. With Klaviyo's smart sending feature on — it prevents someone from receiving multiple emails within a 16 hour period. Because this wasn't in place, they've received all flow and campaign communication, which is likely what prompted them to reach out. We can also certainly create a preference page should people choose to customize their exclusions — we don't typically recommend relying solely on this — but with a strategic campaign segmentation strategy we should be able to prevent this from happening in the future!  
  
The good news: Klaviyo's unsubscribe rate is only up 7% L7 days over the previous 7 days, so the send rate isn't having too large of an impact on the rest of our community. In regards to long-term strategy implications — best practice is between 2-3 campaign sends per week, 4 can be pushing it, unless strategically segmented. We can put together a stronger segmentation strategy based what people viewed, previously ordered, etc. This is the strategy we recommend implementing moving forward. In regards to the campaigns themselves, given the feedback we've heard to date from you all, we're recommending a quality over quantity approach, where we'll be able to dive deeper into the stories, narratives, and data. We'll, of course, want to A/B test more longer-form content against shorter-form content to find what resonates most with our community, but regardless, we're excited about implementing this new longer-form, educational approach.  
  
I hope that helps provide some context! If there's anything else I can help clarify or dive deeper into, please let me know.\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Elyse*

- **2025-05-07 14:47** *User_2Z9G95*: @Elyse – Just sent you the preview. We just need the blog link that I can add to that button! Let me know if there's any thoughts/feedback (the last two paragraphs are new, so please review those!). Since this is still a text-based email, we have pretty limited control in terms of the background design, so we went with more of a beige/off-white background color to add some dimension.

- **2025-05-07 14:57** *Elyse*: one note - we say “might resonate” twice so thinking for bottom blurb:  
  
Even though I’m better able to prioritize self-care now, getting to this point wasn’t easy. I ignored so many warning signs until my body physically forced me to stop with a grand mal seizure. If you’re curious about my journey through motherhood, you can read my full blog post below.  
  
Happy Mother’s Day–to every woman discovering that choosing herself is not selfish, but one of the most powerful ways she can show up for the people she loves.

As next steps, we'll:  
• Look at top-performing evergreen campaigns from last year (+ continue building out the campaign calendar)  
• Provide a weekly reporting summary to keep track of YoY performance  
• Keep flows moving ASAP\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse, :raised_hands: Ingrid*
- **2025-05-13 18:04** *User_2Z9G95*: @Elyse — Just an FYI, outside of the promos, the following were the top revenue-driving campaigns from mid-May to mid-June last year — no surprise, most are red light hat related, so I think a takeaway here is to replicate some (or all) of these stories post MBS launch:  
• Infrared saunas vs. traditional saunas  
• Red light hat before and after (this would be good pre-Father's Day)  
• Red light hat customer feature (also good pre-Father's Day)  
• Red light FAQs  
• Frequency matters - Frequency FAQ\n\n*Reactions: :+1::skin-tone-3: Elyse*
- **2025-05-14 11:47** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse — Looking forward to our copy chat this afternoon! If the team is able to share (either live on the call or after) examples that really nail down the tone of voice that would be helpful. Having a visual/seeing the examples IRL makes it much easier for us to understand. If there's any old email examples, pages on your site, or blog posts we can dissect together that would be fabulous.\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse, :eyes: Elyse*

I think potentially a launch on paid of 5/22 was mentioned, but our formal recco is to move forward with 5/21 as a lot of the market is already on sale and the longer period will benefit the ad learnings! cc @Ari Murray @User*2Z9G95\n\n📎 **HigherDOSE MDW Plan** (gdoc, 0B) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HIM62VuEVzgaNKz0FClHa3v0Ckvmcg-4JlDRVh_MX00/edit?tab=t.0)\n\n*Reactions: :pray: Ari Murray*

When we switch to full launch, we'll just swap out the early access messaging in the subject line for email 1 and the early access messaging in the SMS copy.

- **2025-05-19 18:04** *User_2Z9G95*: @Elyse — Here's our broad segmentation strategy for review! Last year, each email that was sent to the same broad engaged segment reached about 150,000 people, so this year we're broadening it to closer to 290,000. You'll see we have a mix of engaged, unengaged, and lapsed customers:  
  
**Engaged:**  
• 365 days engaged (broadening to people who engaged all year — they're likely waiting for this sale period!)  
• Purchasers (All Time)  
• 180 days engaged, never purchased (Targeted + Broad - difference here depends on how many emails they've received from us; targeted means they received more emails, so they're slightly more engaged)  
• Clicked/opened at least once in the last 365 days, never bought  
**Unengaged:**  
• 180 days unengaged (don't want this to be too broad (365), so we can ensure we're reaching people who haven't engaged without sacrificing engagement too much)  
• Never purchased   
• Never engaged, subscribed 60+ days ago  
**Lapsed:**  
• VIPs - Purchased more than once, but not in the last 60 days  
• Was engaged 30-60 days ago, but not recently (have purchased at somepoint)  
• Purchased once at least 60 days ago, but hasn't opened or clicked in the last 90  
I'll be able to follow up with the re-send segmentation strategy tomorrow once we get some data, but it will likely be those who didn't open and/or didn't click + didn't purchase.  
  
We'll monitor performance and if we need to remove some of the broad unengaged segments, we certainly can! Will keep you posted.  
  
***Question: Any other exclusions we should be aware of? Is the Red Light Hat available abroad? I looked at the sheet you initially shared, but the row isn't filled out. I think that's the only product that's getting a spotlight.*** \n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-05-19 at 2.41.40 PM.png** (png, 176.1KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F08T56Q129G/screenshot_2025-05-19_at_2.41.40___pm.png)

• 10a ET - Lead Generation ads go-live  
• 12p ET - Early Access email + SMS gets sent  
• 7p-9p ET - Early Access email gets re-sent  
Please let us know if you have any questions! @Elyse — Once you confirm the segmentation strategy and the revised early access email I will get those scheduled.

Additionally — the site, browse, and cart abandonment flows we copied each have one campaign, however, to further target these high-intent purchasers, we're recommending adding an additional campaign to be sent 25 hours after the first initial send. We've gone ahead and copied existing flows to create these campaigns and @Elyse — I would love to send those through for review ASAP so we can get them live!  
  
Let me know if there's any thoughts/feedback on the above. Thank you all!\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-05-21 at 11.05.22 AM.png** (png, 104.8KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F08T6CH1JP5/screenshot_2025-05-21_at_11.05.22___am.png)\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Elyse*

- **2025-05-22 13:39** *User_2Z9G95*: Woohoo! And then we have two options for the plain text last chance email on 5/26 — I noticed that in the past HD sends an actual plain-text email, but our team also designed one. Sending through both for you to see which feels better! Alternatively, we can send on in the AM and one in the PM for a last min re-send opportunity.  
  
These are templates, not the campaigns so ignore the subject and preview for now.

- **2025-05-23 15:10** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse! CC: @Ingrid Letting you know everything for this weekend is scheduled and updated [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1csFoxkpwWmYtRuRfOE1QssDtjqMcmRm3wYaUGhYDnrg/edit?pli=1&gid=1474997958#gid=1474997958). We made a few tweaks to this weekend's segments. Since these emails are more product-focused and narrative in messaging, we tweaked the segments to be more engaged-driven. We removed any unengaged segments from this (which will ideally help drive click and open rate back up). We also included engaged, product-focused segments, focusing on those with higher-intent — see below:  
  
• Red Light Hat Spotlight: Added: Engaged L180, but never purchased Red Light Hat  
• PEMF Spotlight: Added: Engaged L180, but never purchased anything from the PEMF collection  
• Father's Day Gifting: Added: Engaged L180, but never purchased anything from the PEMF or Red Light collection  
I've included the full segment breakdown in the sheet if you want to see the others! Let us know if you have any thoughts, but we think targeting engaged segments for the weekend sends will put us in a great place engagement and conversion wise come Monday and Tuesday, when we're ready to double down on last minute/extended sale messaging to our initial broad audience.\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

I can ask Cory if they have any other brands that have seen success with that for inspo, but we'd likely include the evergreen 10% off with the coming soon messaging.
- **2025-05-27 15:51** *Elyse*: let me check with ingrid on that when shes back in office tomorrow. think we’d be okay with it as we’re starting social teasers earlier than email

- **2025-05-29 13:06** *User_2Z9G95*: @Elyse — RE join the waitlist strategy — can I ask the why behind this? Since we already have their emails, what are you looking to do with the information? Segment them and/or send the announcement to them early?  
  
I would maybe propose an SMS push, where we can get people to join SMS for early access. We can send the SMS at like 9:45am ET to give them a bit of a head start before email goes out?

- **2025-05-30 09:00** *User_2Z9G95*: Morning @Elyse — RE discount codes, I was connecting with a Klaviyo and Attentive rep to figure out the best way to go about generating the coupon codes for each platform. They both recommended we create a list of unique codes through Shopify and then upload that list to both Klaviyo and Attentive to pull from. We'd need to select "one use per customer” for the code settings to ensure people can only use one code (even if they get sent two (i.e. if they got one code from Attentive and one from Klaviyo)).  
  
Thoughts? This is likely the best way to ensure people can only use one code, while still leveraging both platforms.  
  
If so, here's what we'd need you to do in Shopify:  
**Go to:** Shopify Admin → **Discounts**  
Click **“Create Discount” → “Discount Code”**  
Choose:  
• Discount Type: e.g., **15% off**  
• Applies to: e.g., all products or your launch collection  
• Limit to one use per customer (highly recommended)  
Under **"Discount Code"**, choose:  
• **“Generate a batch of codes”**  
• Example format: `LAUNCH15-XXXX` (Shopify will auto-randomize)  
• Generate enough for both platforms (e.g., 10,000 codes)  
Save and export the codes as a **CSV**.  
  
From there, I can upload to both Klaviyo and Attentive and get the campaigns scheduled. Let me know what you think, so we can get this going! Thanks!

Attentive initially said that they could integrate them so that the same customer via email and SMS would get the same code (awesome!). Now it's sounding like there's a chance it won't work (we'll know shortly), but if it doesn't their recommendation is that the coupon code can only be provided via email *or* SMS.  
  
Since they aren't totally sure, our recommendation is to pivot to a singular Shopify code that doesn't stack with any other discount (i.e. SCULPT20) - that way we're ensuring its a cohesive experience between both CRM channels and SMS isn't left out because of this code consistency issue. Plus, we want this to be a success and it will only be activated for three days and it's product-specific so the risk of a leak is much lower, yet the risk on the customer is much higher if any of the unique ones are broken.  
  
Please let us know your thoughts on this ASAP and we'll update accordingly.

We have great data from MDW, so we're recommending we send to the same list as the engaged MDW segment that drove the strongest performance with some additions (VIPs, MDW purchasers, etc). Confirming all International will be excluded, too.\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-05-30 at 2.49.35 PM.png** (png, 245.6KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F08V4V4SJV7/screenshot_2025-05-30_at_2.49.35___pm.png)

- **2025-06-02 07:49** *User_2Z9G95*: **One other thing we noticed, we wanted to get your thoughts on:**  
It looks like 29 email subscribers and 11 SMS subscribers already purchased the Ritual Body Sculptor Kit, prior to us officially launching via email and SMS. Since they bought full price without the promotion, I can foresee there being some complaints if they find out they can get it for 20% off (after having purchased it at full price).  
  
**Wanted to get your thoughts on two options for how to handle:**  
1. Exclude them from all MBS emails this week since they already purchased (we're going to exclude purchasers from ongoing emails regardless, but there's still a chance they could find out about the 20% off promotion, so we'd need a customer service plan in place to manage complaints if so)  
2. Include them in the MBS email messaging and have a customer service plan in place for people who reach out about purchasing the product prior to receiving the discount and wanting to get the 20% off on their purchase.  
Please let us know how to proceed with the segmenting of these customers!

I thought 3 days was the default, but I realized the brand I worked on previously had manually updated that. I just triple checked in our account and the default in Attentive, which is what we have is: 1 day view thru and 30 days click thru. As we onboard to Postscript we can figure out what theirs is and modify if we see fit.\n\n*Reactions: :+1::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

- **2025-06-03 15:54** *Ari Murray*: @Elyse our preferred stack is alia popup + postscript backend. we don't use the postscript popup when we have the option for alia as we've historically seen the best results with alia as popup and postscript behind it! cc @User_2Z9G95\n\n*Reactions: :+1::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

- **2025-06-04 12:31** *Elyse*: across the board we need to update copy around code usage
- **2025-06-04 12:31** *Elyse*: its the same as mdw basically, where its no code for the bundles but yes code for the solo tech
- **2025-06-04 12:31** *User_2Z9G95*: Ok, fab! Yep we will get this updated ASAP
- **2025-06-04 12:42** *User_2Z9G95*: @Elyse — I think the collections page with homepage CTA is a good idea! Let me know if you end up doing that, we would want to drive all emails to that page.

- **2025-06-04 13:29** *Elyse*: I think we also have to be careful/mindful of our use of “pain relief” from legal perspective. Using that a lot in the father’s day stuff
- **2025-06-04 13:32** *User_2Z9G95*: Ok good shout! What has legal said specifically? Should we avoid it altogether? What can we say instead? Eases paid, eases sore muscles, etc.?
- **2025-06-04 13:32** *Elyse*: Just that its a bold/medical claim
- **2025-06-04 13:32** *Elyse*: so eases sore muscles, soothes tense muscles etc\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: User_2Z9G95*
- **2025-06-04 13:34** *Elyse*: things of that nature
- **2025-06-04 13:34** *Elyse*: like with MBS, people reported pain relief - we can’t say that, but talent can
- **2025-06-04 13:35** *Elyse*: so if influencer posts oh relieved pain in my sore xyz thats fine, but we can’t say will relieve xyz pain
- **2025-06-04 13:35** *Elyse*: so just wanna be mindful of our use there
- **2025-06-04 13:37** *Elyse*: I’d love if we could take a second spin through Father’s Day doc with that in mind @User_2Z9G95
- **2025-06-04 13:38** *Elyse*: I left a few notes on the doc, circulating to team now as well
- **2025-06-04 13:44** *Elyse*: Gave first round notes on 6/12 as well @User_2Z9G95

- **2025-06-04 14:14** *Elyse*: also @User_2Z9G95 father’s day flash sale should be 48 hours instead of 24
- **2025-06-04 14:33** *Elyse*: @User_2Z9G95 just went through all the flows except welcome, will dive into that shortly. Left a bunch of notes but also circulated to the team so feel free to not make any adjustments yet til we get some more eyes on these\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: User_2Z9G95*

- **2025-06-05 09:25** *User_2Z9G95*: Thank you! As a side — I was going through the rest of the existing flows yesterday and wanted to get some clarity on additional ones we can update:  
1. All of the subscription related ones — how recently were those updated? Are you interested in a full redesign or just updating the footer?  
2. What is Reclaim? Are those flows still active and being used? They haven't triggered anything this year so I'm assuming not, but want to check! Safe to say we can disregard those?  
3. Loyalty Lion flows — how recently were those updated? Same note as subscription, we're happy to redesign!
- **2025-06-05 10:04** *Elyse*: All flows probably last updated within maybe a year or two. Could definitely use a full refresh across the board\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: User_2Z9G95*
- **2025-06-05 10:04** *Elyse*: I’d love your thoughts on the Loyalty Lion ones, if there’s anything we can be optimizing there
- **2025-06-05 11:08** *User_2Z9G95*: Perfect! This is super helpful context. We’ll keep prioritizing the pre purchase ones (cart, welcome, etc). and will get optimizations integrated for those, too!

- **2025-06-06 12:50** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse! Following up here with our finalized Father's Day Strategy. We recommend holding on the third SMS and segmenting the first one to ensure we're targeting those who are engaged first, and then broadening it (to avoid fatigue and overcommunication). Please let us know if you have any thoughts/questions.  
  
• Email 6/8:  
    ◦ Engaged segments (purchasers + non-purchasers)  
• MMS 6/8:  
    ◦ Engaged L365  
• Email 6/9:  
    ◦ Engaged segments (purchasers + non-purchasers), but exclude anyone who just purchased during the sale  
• SMS 6/9:  
    ◦ All subscribers, exclude purchasers  
• Email 6/9: [PM] Engaged segments (purchasers + non-purchasers), but exclude anyone who just purchased during the sale  
With that, these are the two SMS we recommend sending. Please let us know if you're aligned!\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-06 at 10.40.00 AM.png** (png, 261.4KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F09067TU96J/screenshot_2025-06-06_at_10.40.00___am.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-06 at 10.40.11 AM.png** (png, 88.8KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F090B135085/screenshot_2025-06-06_at_10.40.11___am.png)\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

- **2025-06-06 15:08** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Ingrid @Elyse — Happy Friday! Following up with the May CRM deep-dive. [Here's a link to our weekly agenda with May YoY performance and insights at the top](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qW1zFK0lAJNgYV8BTtu4loP*bDVGL7l80a8V0IybvTg/edit?tab=t.0), along with our [CRM Reporting Tracker with MoM totals](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtJOU2541YSnoXC7ccA-RRUy2E*ctEOXQUXO3AdPWU4/edit?gid=1153635090#gid=1153635090).  
  
**May YoY Summary:**  
TLDR; the biggest areas impacting May's performance are a lot of what we've already discussed. We aren't changing much with segmentation apart from broadening where it makes sense and in terms of traffic/recipient's receiving communications, it's all very in-line with last year's metrics. Regardless, here's what heavily impacted that performance:  
  
• Not having a new product launch (like last year)  
• Lower Mother's Day performance (consumers love a gift with purchase)  
• Flows (mainly abandoned checkout, abandoned browse, welcome flow)  
• Broadened campaign segmentation strategy impacted click rates, but allowed us to reach more people and drive significant growth for MDW  
In addition to getting new flow content live ASAP, as an immediate next step, we're going to take a deeper look and how each flow is set up to make sure they're firing correctly. We will keep you posted on findings here!  
  
**On the upside, SMS drove a 100% increase YoY**, so we're going to continue to double down on driving growth and engagement through this channel. If we look at this year's total performance, **May was our strongest month (for both email and SMS), with the lowest declines to date (just 10%).**  
  
**June MTD Summary:**  
**From Shopify — I'm also happy to report that we've sold 758 Body Sculptor Ritual Sets so far, generating $249,711.02 in net sales. We've already driven $111,080.83 from Klaviyo and $86,029.15 from Attentive. Together, we're already 65% towards our CRM revenue goal for June — let's keep it up!**  
  
I hope this information is helpful — as always, please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions!\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

Looking at L365 on Shopify, we see the most orders/sessions come in between 12p-2p ET and 8p-10p ET. So we've added the test for 12p vs. 8p ET to see if there's any statistically significant differences.\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*
- **2025-06-11 18:48** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse — thanks for your patience here. Please see high-level data and reccos below.  
  
**Summary:**  
TLDR; given our growth goals and what we want to achieve this year, we feel that Alia and Instant would be great integrations to help get us there. Together, both of these will help us better understand our customer journey because we'll have the high-converting pop-up (converting even more new users to subscribers) coupled with engaging flows capturing anonymous users. Both will help expand our lists and get new subscribers further down the funnel (with targeted messaging). Plus, they're both month-to-month, so there's no long-term contracts involved, and are reasonably priced within the market. Plus they have great customer support teams we greatly trust!  
  
**Instant Audiences:**  
I don't have access to Instant's full dashboard (I'm sure we'll get some insight tomorrow), but according to Klaviyo (L30 days), these are the Instant Audience Flows that generated the most revenue:  
• $27,223.08 in additional Klaviyo revenue from their Abandoned Checkout Flow (didn't outperform the regular Abandoned Checkout Flow ($53K), but still contributed incremental revenue)  
• $20,789.18 in additional Klaviyo revenue from their MDW Sale Abandoned Checkout Flow (didn't outperform the regular MDW Sale Abandoned Checkout Flow ($41K), but still contributed incremental revenue)  
• $10,901.45 in additional Klaviyo revenue from their MDW Sale Abandoned Cart Flow (outperformed the regular MDW Sale Abandoned Cart Flow ($8K))  
• $7,729.69 in additional Klaviyo revenue from their Browse Abandonment Flow ((didn't outperform the regular Abandoned Checkout Flow ($30K), but still contributed incremental revenue)  
We're seeing the greatest success from the checkout and cart abandonment flow (which makes sense as this is the furthest down the funnel), but we're eager to get Instant Audience Flows integrated with our new Abandonment Flows that are being designed.  
  
**Alia:**  
For Alia (L30 days), we're seeing:  
• 6.36% email sign up rate  
• 4.62% SMS sign up rate  
In Klaviyo specifically, we hav:  
• 2,373 customers tagged with beauty & skincare  
• 1,961 customers tagged with detox & cleanse  
• 1,569 customers tagged with recovery & muscle relief  
• 1,161 customers tagged with relaxation & stress relief  
• and in total we've captured 10,206 new subscribers from Alia-specific pop-ups  
In Attentive specifically, we have:  
• 779 customers tagged with beauty & skincare  
• 621 customers tagged with detox & cleanse  
• 472 customers tagged with recovery & muscle relief  
• 331 customers tagged with relaxation & stress relief  
• and in total, we've captured 2,757 new subscribers from the Alia-specific pop-ups  
From our previous evergreen Attentive pop-up, we saw about 3%-4% opt-in for email and a 1%-2% opt-in for SMS, so we're definitely seeing improvements with Alia. If there's a concern around how often it's triggering, let's tell the team we want it to only show to new visitors or exclude those who sign up — we have a lot of control in terms of how we want the pop-ups to look/function and Alia gives us a dedicated contact to work through that with us (which is definitely one of the perks!). Having Alia's strong functionality coupled with our new, more personalized welcome flow will also provide an ever better brand intro and customer journey.

- **2025-06-12 13:56** *Elyse*: both orders are for the MBS only, which hasn’t shipped. weird that it would send this msg
- **2025-06-12 13:57** *User_2Z9G95*: I seeeee, so at first glance, I think it has to do with how the order is updated in Shopify. I can't see order data in Shopify, so if someone could show me what those orders show as the most recent update, that would be helpful

I've seen it get a bit finicky before, but mine worked great, so just wanted to make sure. I'll have 1-2 Sharma members test it out, too, just to double confirm!

- **2025-06-17 15:14** *User_2Z9G95* 💬 6 replies: Hi @Elyse — Just got the notification from Attentive that we're out of the GetDosed10 codes — are you able to download more when you get the chance? Not sure if there's a cap you can share, but maybe 10K?
- **2025-06-17 17:04** *User_2Z9G95* 💬 5 replies: Hi team — sharing a quick status update from our call today. Link to the agenda **[HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qW1zFK0lAJNgYV8BTtu4loP*bDVGL7l80a8V0IybvTg/edit?tab=t.0)**. High-level summary below:  
  
Account Health:  
The biggest thing I wanted to share with you is that we saw some funky things in the WoW data and after doing a deep dive noticed there was a huge influx in bot clicks this time last year, which is inflating last year's data (making it seem like this year is significantly down when it isn't!). No worries though, nothing is being impacted in our account right now, we just noticed that influx heavily skewed last year's metrics.  
  
*There is an action we can take in the account to remove bot clicks from our data — happy to chat through that more to see if we'd want to do that!*  
  
Flows:  
Flows are moving along — we have a handful [ready for review in the tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1csFoxkpwWmYtRuRfOE1QssDtjqMcmRm3wYaUGhYDnrg/edit?pli=1&amp;gid=1474997958#gid=1474997958).  
  
Campaigns:  
Elyse — if you get a chance to look at [July concepts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gEGU3563QuaRxhUVGw59ckRrGTtbKs5qHkHXnwB*p2M/edit?tab=t.0) this week that would be amazing!  
  
LMK if you have any questions. Have a great evening!\n\n*Reactions: :heart: User_5S72LT, Elyse*
    - **2025-06-17 18:34** *User_2Z9G95*: ↳ Hi @Elyse — Following up on this! There's a Post-Purchase Flow live that is triggering that message. The trigger is "made a purchase", so that's why they got it. Does this flow ring a bell to you? If not, I would recommend we turn it off.\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-17 at 4.34.04 PM.png** (png, 92.6KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F091R6H0LLW/screenshot_2025-06-17_at_4.34.04___pm.png)
- **2025-06-17 18:36** *Elyse*: So @User_2Z9G95 am I understanding this correctly - anyone who makes a purchase at all gets this?
- **2025-06-17 18:39** *User_2Z9G95*: Correct. It's slated to send 10 days after the purchase, so ideally the product has arrived by then, which shouldn't be an issue. But in this case it is. There's a few post-purchase flows live right now. Will take a look at them and see where we need to optimize.
- **2025-06-17 18:39** *Elyse*: Ahhhh ok got it
- **2025-06-17 18:40** *Elyse*: I wonder, is there no way on attentive (which note to self let’s check out on post script) to make the trigger more directly connected to a Shopify action (like tracking add/marked as fulfilled) vs just the general timeline of 10 days?
- **2025-06-17 18:41** *Elyse*: Thinking about orders that arrive sooner but also orders that are on back order or just generally take longer 
- **2025-06-17 18:42** *Elyse*: I mean there’s probably a very very rare scenario where someone gets an order more than ten days later that isn’t related to a back order or preorder 
- **2025-06-17 18:43** *Elyse*: But thinking about when people buy saunas too, that’s def a longer turnaround time than ten days
- **2025-06-17 18:43** *User_2Z9G95*: Yes! There are the same transactional triggers as in Klaviyo (order shipped, order delivered, out for delivery, etc.) — not sure why whoever set this one up did it that way, maybe there was a reason, but we will definitely update when we migrate.\n\n*Reactions: :+1::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

- **2025-07-01 13:58** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse @Ingrid — Thank you so much for the time today as always! [Here's a link to the agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qW1zFK0lAJNgYV8BTtu4loP_bDVGL7l80a8V0IybvTg/edit?tab=t.0) for review. I added in an analysis of the unsubscribe rate. TLDR; The major daily spikes in follower loss fell on our heavy promotional days (MBS launch, Father's Day Flash) — no surprise there!  
  
While total unsubscribes increased compared to last year, list growth remains positive (we're bringing in more people than those who are leaving!):  
• Average daily unsubscribes: 144  
• Average daily new subscribers: 296  
    ◦ This shows a strong net growth, with the list expanding at nearly a 2:1 rate.  
And if we look at a average YoY comparison, it’s actually proportional to increased campaign volume and list size. As reach expands, higher unsubscribe rates are expected.  
• June 2024: 193 new subscribers per day, 104 unsubscribes per day  
• June 2025: 296 new subscribers per day, 144 unsubscribes per day  
In sum, there isn't anything alarming — we'll continue to monitor the declines MoM, but everything we're seeing is just a result of more promotional campaigns + an expanding list (which is good!).\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

- **2025-07-02 13:40** *User_2Z9G95*: @Elyse — RE the Klaviyo code exclusion update, it's all dependent on the collection the code is tied to. The collection it's tied to is called "Can be discounted" so I would assume bundles shouldn't be in there. I don't have access, but can you take a look at that collection and see if bundles are in there? It may be best to remove them, or I can select a different collection if there's a better one to use!

I've also included a Tri-State area segment and excluded CAN/EU, given the Montauk inclusion, but if you feel like we should include them, let me know!

- **2025-07-08 14:25** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse — Thanks so much for the time today! [Here's a link to the initial postscript automations for review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19U*x-DHbtn7dNwNq7JL8xHdkMHOMkOAl8kY0G8o2Wjg/edit?tab=t.0). Let me know if you have any questions! @Ingrid — Feel free to review our weekly summary below + [agenda here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qW1zFK0lAJNgYV8BTtu4loP*bDVGL7l80a8V0IybvTg/edit?tab=t.0)!  
  
Shopify Summary:  
• This year MTD: 0.21% to goal with $30K in revenue   
• Last year MTD: 0.23% to goal with $27K in revenue  
Key Performance Insights:  
• Klaviyo-attributed campaign revenue is down 17% mainly because we've only sent two campaigns so far (two additional will be sent to help us round out the week)  
• Klaviyo-attributed flow revenue is up 53% YoY mainly attributed to our welcome and browse abandonment flows. We saw 150% more recipients receiving these flows which means more people are entering our funnel and are flows are converting them!   
    ◦ After speaking with the paid team, this increase in flow performance/sessions could be attributed to more customers coming in from the combo of AppLovin' and TikTok — adding more touch points into the customer journey.   
• We don't have any SMS-attributed revenue because we're still onboarding. We're hoping to be fully live by tomorrow EOD, so we can start generating revenue from our new campaigns and automations.   
Instant will be joining our next call on Tuesday, so we'll plan to start with an Instant summary at the beginning of that call (5-10 mins) prior to jumping into our weekly.\n\n📎 **HigherDOSE <> Sharma Brands CRM Agenda ** (gdoc, 0B) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qW1zFK0lAJNgYV8BTtu4loP_bDVGL7l80a8V0IybvTg/edit?tab=t.0)\n📎 **FOR REVIEW: Postscript Automations** (gdoc, 107.9KB) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19U_x-DHbtn7dNwNq7JL8xHdkMHOMkOAl8kY0G8o2Wjg/edit?tab=t.0)

- **2025-07-08 17:47** *User_2Z9G95*: Looks great! RE higherdose hacks, I think we can just have one CTA for each: [Shop Katie's Pick's], [Shop Jessica's Picks], [Shop Anastasia's Picks] and have each one link to the collections page. Thoughts?

- **2025-07-09 12:57** *Elyse* 💬 1 reply: left notes on postscript list - going to show ingrid in a few mins so may have more notes @User_2Z9G95
- **2025-07-09 14:56** *Elyse*: @User*2Z9G95 Ingrid and I just went through all the flows. Here are our notes:  
  
Big takeaway - the abandon series feels very generic/vague with subject lines and preview text. We’d love to run that whole series, plus welcome emails through the **[new product pillars doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TviOjzGtgGUhRuFDcaCLu3ePCtHVB0RDgFUrFvS1bhE/edit?usp=sharing)**. I just saw this for the first time today and think it’s spot on for language and where we want these flows to be. Here’s also the **[new manifesto doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w*C60nIHyiDn_VoDrXSXTJw46C6MyhGS-yrIZMw5AuI/edit?usp=sharing)** - it’s very much a working doc but is a great reference of the voice we want to be speaking in  
  
With replen flow - left notes on figma, but one note for the Shop By Goal design: we’d love to see which version performs better via email campaign. So want to think about where we can put that block into an appropriate email and test whether the lifestyle photo vs product photo does better with engagement and then implement that into the flows  
  
I’m setting up a call with Lauren to review design and everything as a whole for Monday/Tuesday so if we can somehow get outstanding copy polished up before then so I can present everything at once would be sick\n\n📎 **HIGHERDOSE PRODUCT PILLARS** (gdoc, 0B) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TviOjzGtgGUhRuFDcaCLu3ePCtHVB0RDgFUrFvS1bhE/edit?usp=sharing)\n📎 **HigherDOSE Manifesto_v3** (gdoc, 0B) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w_C60nIHyiDn_VoDrXSXTJw46C6MyhGS-yrIZMw5AuI/edit?usp=sharing)
- **2025-07-09 15:01** *Elyse*: Replen flows  
• glow serum email is underwhelming. want to swap out for better photos, and left notes for ingredient highlights  
• detox drops email looks good, want to swap the bottom shop by goal photos a bit so that its not beige beige beige blue  
• oxytocin oil email is missing ingredient breakdown and review highlight  
• highdration powder we loved the ingredient highlight design, and decided for the reviews we’d like to do a single review static image instead of the gif so its not too much to read while in reviews in motion  
    ◦ any emails that are still in copy, we picked which review we want on the doc
- **2025-07-09 15:12** *Elyse*: Same thing for Postscript automations copy - would love to toss that to Chandler and rework through new pillars/manifesto language @User_2Z9G95 I put some notes directly on the doc but want to revisit overall now having those two new docs
- **2025-07-09 15:15** *Elyse*: Diving in to wonderment and loyalty lion emails now
- **2025-07-09 15:31** *Elyse*: @User_2Z9G95 Loyalty Lion emails - would also love to run through those again with the new lens of the pillars/manifesto docs. They feel very generic loyalty, especially the subject lines. Want them to feel more elevated/high end/luxury brand, more exclusive, and more community nurturing if that makes sense
- **2025-07-09 15:33** *Elyse*: Subject line of “Score” is wildly off brand for HD, so must must must rework those
- **2025-07-09 15:42** *Elyse* 💬 1 reply: @User_2Z9G95 could you do me a favor please? Can you send me a test of the order shipped, out for delivery, and delivered emails as they are now please? Want to be able to compare
- **2025-07-09 15:46** *User_2Z9G95*: Thank you so much for this detailed feedback @Elyse! Will pass the Product Pillars and Manifesto doc around so that everyone has access to it for anything needed RE brand voice. This is super helpful!\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

- **2025-07-11 09:32** *Elyse*: @User_2Z9G95 just looked a postscript updated copy - moving in a better direction. so i do love the “lit up, deeply restored, and unapologetically radiant” i just think we shouldn’t say it back to back in like a handful of different texts. like imagine you’re a customer and get it in the welcome flow, then you abandon something you’re seeing that copy again, etc it feels redundant in a spot where we have opportunity to say something different each time  
@Ingrid do you have any thoughts here?

- **2025-07-11 12:07** *User_2Z9G95* 💬 3 replies: Hi @Elyse! I just connected with Chandler and she's working through the flows today and early next week. Given that some of the emails need to be completely re-thought and re-done, we won't be able to have everything ready by Monday or Tuesday next week. Here's a summary of what we can do though:  
• By Monday EOD:  
    ◦ 7/21 campaign  
    ◦ 7/25 campaign  
    ◦ Replenishment flows  
    ◦ Abandoned Cart  
    ◦ Abandoned Checkout  
• By Tuesday EOD:  
    ◦ Abandoned Browse  
• By Wednesday EOD:  
    ◦ Wonderment flows  
    ◦ Loyalty Lion flows  
Given that the Welcome needs another re-write with the new TOV doc, we won't be able to have that done for early next week. We're moving to keep pushing these along as quickly as we can and appreciate your patience as we continue to work through these.  
  
We also had a few questions on some feedback left:  
• I saw you left a comment in [this Figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/tS7RlljzjfnN1HZZYe0l2L/HigherDOSE-%E2%80%93-Flows?node-id=33332-2180&amp;p=f&amp;t=AyOdrmbkH5d1DFMB-0) about providing copy. Is the plan just to condense that's already in there? Or what exactly needs to be modified? Thank you!  
• And for [this one](https://www.figma.com/design/tS7RlljzjfnN1HZZYe0l2L/HigherDOSE-%E2%80%93-Flows?node-id=39049-706&amp;t=E9aBNCdqOehg4OEI-0), do you have the one-liner about being fragrance-free/the scent we can add?  
I just realized I never sent you the tests for order update emails — so sorry! I actually can't send previews of transactional emails that are live, so I'll thread screenshots for you now, so you can review [those](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EkwlQlnlt16vUmyOQIjFMry4VW1bjBkJCvk1yUBuEqo/edit?tab=t.0)! Keep us posted on feedback there.  
  
One other outstanding item:  
1. We're waiting on some more context for the [Permission to Play](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WZsdfIu4Kan39TuUpV45mOOaxyasC-6B45nPEdCL_us/edit?tab=t.pgznx7hfmnnk) concepts for July.  
**One note from us:** Chandler will be OOO 7/21-7/25 and we're hoping to have the first week of August content in hand ASAP so she can get copy drafted for them. I see something about the Red Light Wrap Launch — if that's happening we need to have all context by early next week for us to work on the copy (+ we'd need to pause work on flows to accommodate that new product launch). Please let us know ASAP on that!

- **2025-07-14 14:00** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse ! We're working to evolve our internal briefing process and were thinking we could also implement this to help streamline our approval process with you all, too! As you're building out August concepts, would you be able to integrate this framework for them so that we can ensure we're giving the team as much information upfront as possible? I know we don't always have access to the info this far in advance (totally fine), but the more info we can share the better! I'm also happy to support where needed — let me know your thoughts!  
  
• Campaign overview:  
• Goal of the email:  
• Products to feature:  
• If this campaign has multiple themes or blocks (i.e. a blog and a product feature), what is the hierarchy of messaging?  
• If additional research is needed from our team, please link any helpful resources (or let us know where we should be diving deeper):  
• Do you need to source any additional information internally before we get started?  
• CTAs:

- **2025-07-15 11:54** *User_2Z9G95*: A/B test previews sent! Is there a data point in particular you're looking for with the A/B test? The "Finally here" one feels pretty promotional and doesn't give much context into what's inside the email (which is a really cool Q&amp;A). I'm wondering if the initial version that calls out Helen Leland is better to lean into here? Or maybe we can modify it slightly to A/B test leaning with the product in the subject versus leading with the narrative in the subject. Curious if calling out Q&amp;A directly drives stronger engagement, too, since we typically see those perform well!  
  
**Version A: Original**  
**Subject:** Finally here: The Microcurrent Body Sculptor  
**Preview:** Shipping is live — grab yours now  
  
**Version A: NEW**  
**Subject:** Now Shipping: The Microcurrent Body Sculptor  
**Preview:** + A Q&amp;A with Helen Leland  
  
**Version B:**   
**Subject:** The (new) summer body with Helen Leland  
**Preview:** Activate your postural muscles with the Microcurrent Body Sculptor  
  
This is what we had for the Father's Day Q&amp;A, that drove a really high open rate.

I'll of course be available if anything comes up, but we should be in a really good place by Thursday with things approved/scheduled out. Let's stay close! Feel free to tag @User_5S72LT with any edit requests or questions while I'm out/for an extra set of eyes. Thank you, both!! CC: @Ari Murray

- **2025-07-16 12:19** *Chris Jacob*: Hi all can you advise on any key outbound email dates planned for the next week? We need to rollover the domain hosting which could cause a hiccup in this regard and we should probably also test a small outbound email once its setup new to make sure there's no issues
- **2025-07-16 12:23** *Elyse*: Nothing major major happening. Have emails scheduled for 7/18, 21 23 and 25 I believe
- **2025-07-16 12:23** *Elyse*: But all content/general product pushes no major initiatives
- **2025-07-16 14:07** *User_2Z9G95* 💬 1 reply: Hi @Chris Jacob — yes, we can definitely do that. Just building off what Elyse said, here's our email/SMS plan. Should we move anything around? Is there a day the rollover is happening? We can plan to not send any emails/SMS then.

- **2025-07-16 18:09** *Elyse*: @User_2Z9G95 both previews good to go
- **2025-07-17 13:42** *User_2Z9G95*: Hi @Elyse + @Ingrid — I wanted to share some notes on a discount strategy for our abandoned flows. I've included what is live today and what we'd recommend changing below. Based on your feedback, I think we're all on the same page, but let us know if you have any other thoughts:  
  
• WELCOME10:  
    ◦ 10% off code that is live in Welcome Email #1, Site Abandonment Email #1, #2, and #3  
        ▪︎ We'd recommend including this in at least one other Welcome Email as well (last chance/driving urgency)  
        ▪︎ We'd recommend removing this from all Site Abandonment emails (top of funnel is focused on awareness/brand)  
• HIGHERSELF10:  
    ◦ 10% off code that is live in Abandoned Checkout Email #1 and Email #2  
    ◦ We'd recommend removing it from Abandoned Checkout email #1 and leaving it in just email #2.   
• FLASH10:  
    ◦ 10% off code that is live in Abandoned Browse Email #2, and Abandoned Cart Email #2  
    ◦ We'd recommend removing this from all Abandoned Browse emails (top of funnel is focused on awareness/brand)  
    ◦ We'd recommend leaving it in just Abandoned Cart email #2.   
I know we mentioned wanting to remove all FLASH messaging as well — if you'd like us to create a new code to put in the abandoned cart emails, let us know!  
  
All copy docs have been updated to reflect this strategy, but I just wanted to cover off on the updates we're making from the existing flows. Let us know if you have any questions!
- **2025-07-17 13:52** *Elyse*: Aligned on all of the above
- **2025-07-17 13:52** *Elyse*: @Ingrid confirm good by you?

Now that we've launched Postscript, we're pacing closer to our goal. We're 58% through the month and we're 64% to our goal. We have a strong content marketing strategy planned for the rest of the month, so we're confident in maintaining momentum. We'll continue to monitor performance closely and optimize in real time to ensure we finish strong. We've made great progress on the email flows this week and are excited to hear Lauren's thoughts next week. Let us know if you have any questions. Enjoy the weekend!\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Sumish Khadka, :raised_hands::skin-tone-3: Elyse*

- **2025-07-22 18:51** *User_2Z9G95*: Hey team! Sorry for the delay — [here's a link to the agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qW1zFK0lAJNgYV8BTtu4loP_bDVGL7l80a8V0IybvTg/edit?tab=t.0) we reviewed today and a high-level summary below:  
  
We're 70% through the month and 77% to our goal, so we're still pacing above and maintaining good momentum. We've driven $109K so far, so we're looking to drive $33K more. We have 6 more emails going out and 2 more SMS, so we should be in a good place.  
  
In regards to the flows, we went through all of the feedback and have put together this go-forward plan:  
• Hannah to build out templates of all 7 emails based on feedback  
• Hannah to send templates to Elyse for review/approval  
• Once approved, Elyse will get approval from Ingrid/Lauren/all stakeholders  
• Once approved, Hannah/Chandler will update copy over the next week + pass along to Elyse to review/approve with Ingrid/Lauren/all stakeholders  
• Once approved, Hannah will pass to design  
I'm hoping to have the templates done tomorrow, so you can have those ready to review and we can keep moving these along.\n\n📎 **HigherDOSE <> Sharma Brands CRM Agenda ** (gdoc, 0B) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qW1zFK0lAJNgYV8BTtu4loP_bDVGL7l80a8V0IybvTg/edit?tab=t.0)\n\n*Reactions: :1000: Elyse*
