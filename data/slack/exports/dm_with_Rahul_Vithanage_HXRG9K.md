- **2025-07-01 13:09** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey Jourdan, mind checking with Ingrid too on her availability and circling back to me? I do want to lock in that slot w/ the reps before it's blocked out.
- **2025-07-01 13:10** *Rahul Vithanage*: Thanks so much in advance!
- **2025-07-01 13:11** *Jourdan*: Yo @Rahul Vithanage she’s not free until after 1pm pst
- **2025-07-01 13:11** *Rahul Vithanage*: Oh shoot, that's fine. Let me get some slots from our Google reps for Thursday and Friday.
- **2025-07-01 13:16** *Jourdan*: Okay cool cool
- **2025-07-01 13:16** *Jourdan*: She has a gap at 1030 on thursday but its in between calls so not sure if she would want something scheduled then
- **2025-07-01 13:17** *Jourdan*: 1230pm pst + she’s free on thursday\n\n*Reactions: :fire: Rahul Vithanage*
- **2025-07-01 13:17** *Jourdan*: Friday 12-1230 then again after 2pm
- **2025-07-01 13:17** *Rahul Vithanage*: This is VERY helpful Jourdan, thank you!
- **2025-07-01 13:18** *Rahul Vithanage*: I'll make sure to circle back
- **2025-07-01 13:21** *Jourdan*: Okay awesome and you’re welcome man\n\n*Reactions: :heart: Rahul Vithanage*
- **2025-07-09 12:44** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey Jourdan, I'm actually free rn. Do you want to get on a quick huddle?
- **2025-07-09 12:45** *Rahul Vithanage*: I just feel like there's quite a few moving parts on Google right now and definitely want us to be on the same page
- **2025-07-09 12:51** *Jourdan*: Yeah man let’s jump on \n\n*Reactions: :heart: Rahul Vithanage*
- **2025-07-09 12:51** *Jourdan*: Can do huddle or Google meets 
- **2025-07-09 12:51** *Rahul Vithanage*: what's your preference Jourdan?
- **2025-07-09 12:52** *Jourdan*: Lets huddle
- **2025-07-09 12:52** *Slackbot*: 
- **2025-07-10 10:01** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey Jourdan, just reaching out and giving you a heads up about our GA4 tracking setup.  
  
For context, we received a warning from Shopify that the current Google tag setup might break when they update their checkout flows around August. They recommended that we set up Google tags through the Google &amp; YouTube shopify plug in to avoid this risk. To get ahead of this, we set up a call with Google’s tag specialist team. On the call, we managed to successfully complete the new tag configuration for Google Ads, but the GA4 tracking migration is still in progress.  
  
I’ll loop you into the email thread shortly and share the next steps as I see them. Ideally, I’d love for you to act as the bridge between the Cardinal team (managing the live site and current tags) and the Annatta team (managing the new site theme and tag configuration) to carry out this migration smoothly. Does that work for you? Let me know :blush: Alternatively, I can be the bridge too but wanted to align with you first.
- **2025-07-10 13:44** *Jourdan*: Yeah man that works for me. I haven’t been introduced to either parties on site management yet so this will be a good intro for me so I have context. Thank you for aligning with me first!\n\n*Reactions: :heart: Rahul Vithanage*
- **2025-07-11 06:05** *Rahul Vithanage*: Of course Jourdan! Will loop you into the thread shortly
- **2025-07-16 12:49** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey Jourdan :relaxed:, looping back on the TROAS adjustment on Google Ads (and sorry for the delay here!).  
I know Tori suggested testing this on the **Non-Brand Sauna Blanket Pmax** campaign but that campaign is actually one of the campaigns driving **incremental revenue as a result of the Pmax scaling test**, so I’d recommend leaving it as is for now to ensure we end up capturing that campaign as a part of the scaling test. Also don't want to pull back on something that's working.  
What are your thoughts on testing the TROAS adjustment on the **US*PMax*Brand*Consumables** campaign instead? That’s one of two campaigns that hasn’t shown incremental revenue post-scaling. The other is **US*PMax*Brand*AllProducts**, but since that campaign was the most heavily scaled, adjusting TROAS there might risk ending the scaling test prematurely.  
Let me know what you think!
- **2025-07-16 21:28** *Jourdan*: Hey @Rahul Vithanage I’m aligned with your perspective on leaving Non-Brand SB campaign alone. The Consumables campaign is at a 2.71 L7 in platform with spend down 5% so what do you think will happen to the performance here?  
  
All products performance looks great so that campaign is rebounding compared to previous period and I wouldn’t want to mess with T ROAS.
- **2025-07-16 21:29** *Jourdan*: We’ve really got to push revenue so getting soft on spend isn’t ideal
- **2025-07-17 07:02** *Rahul Vithanage*: Got it Jourdan. In that case do you want to hold off on the TROAS scale given that it will certainly cause lower spend in whichever campaign we decide to implement it in? ROAS will likely improve but spend will certainly drop in that campaign, although, we can assess by how much it drops by, so we have some sort of a baseline. Let me know how you feel.
- **2025-07-17 13:30** *Jourdan*: Yeah i agree we should probably hold off on it for now. We should be done with the spend test tomorrow right?\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Rahul Vithanage*

- **2025-07-17 13:31** *Rahul Vithanage*: Yes, we'll be done with the scaling test tomorrow
- **2025-07-23 08:38** *Rahul Vithanage* 💬 1 reply: Hey @Jourdan, this is to confirm that the top revenue generating products on Google (L7D) shared on yesterday's call are also quite efficient in terms of a ROAS perspective.\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Jourdan*

- **2025-07-23 16:27** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Jourdan wanted to follow up regarding GA4 tracking set up migration. Lmk if you have any updates for us :pray::skin-tone-4:
- **2025-07-23 16:29** *Jourdan*: Yo! I haven’t heard anything myself so will need to follow up in that thread you connected me in
- **2025-07-24 07:11** *Rahul Vithanage*: I think the first step is to get the Cardinal team (who isn't on that thread) to confirm if the current GA4 tracking configuration is tracking data accurately. Then you might need to connect Annatta and Cardinal so that Cardinal can remove the current GA4 tag set up while, simultaneously, Annatta implements the new set up by setting up the "Google & YouTube" app on Shopify.
- **2025-07-24 07:13** *Rahul Vithanage*: Let me know once you get to the point where the two teams are connecting for the tracking migration. Perhaps I myself can join the call to assist you guys as well.

- **2025-07-09 12:44** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey Jourdan, I'm actually free rn. Do you want to get on a quick huddle?
- **2025-07-09 12:45** *Rahul Vithanage*: I just feel like there's quite a few moving parts on Google right now and definitely want us to be on the same page
- **2025-07-09 12:51** *Jourdan*: Yeah man let’s jump on \n\n*Reactions: :heart: Rahul Vithanage*
- **2025-07-09 12:51** *Jourdan*: Can do huddle or Google meets 
- **2025-07-09 12:51** *Rahul Vithanage*: what's your preference Jourdan?
- **2025-07-09 12:52** *Jourdan*: Lets huddle

- **2025-07-10 10:01** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey Jourdan, just reaching out and giving you a heads up about our GA4 tracking setup.  
  
For context, we received a warning from Shopify that the current Google tag setup might break when they update their checkout flows around August. They recommended that we set up Google tags through the Google &amp; YouTube shopify plug in to avoid this risk. To get ahead of this, we set up a call with Google’s tag specialist team. On the call, we managed to successfully complete the new tag configuration for Google Ads, but the GA4 tracking migration is still in progress.  
  
I’ll loop you into the email thread shortly and share the next steps as I see them. Ideally, I’d love for you to act as the bridge between the Cardinal team (managing the live site and current tags) and the Annatta team (managing the new site theme and tag configuration) to carry out this migration smoothly. Does that work for you? Let me know :blush: Alternatively, I can be the bridge too but wanted to align with you first.
- **2025-07-10 13:44** *Jourdan*: Yeah man that works for me. I haven’t been introduced to either parties on site management yet so this will be a good intro for me so I have context. Thank you for aligning with me first!\n\n*Reactions: :heart: Rahul Vithanage*
- **2025-07-11 06:05** *Rahul Vithanage*: Of course Jourdan! Will loop you into the thread shortly
- **2025-07-16 12:49** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey Jourdan :relaxed:, looping back on the TROAS adjustment on Google Ads (and sorry for the delay here!).  
I know Tori suggested testing this on the **Non-Brand Sauna Blanket Pmax** campaign but that campaign is actually one of the campaigns driving **incremental revenue as a result of the Pmax scaling test**, so I’d recommend leaving it as is for now to ensure we end up capturing that campaign as a part of the scaling test. Also don't want to pull back on something that's working.  
What are your thoughts on testing the TROAS adjustment on the **US*PMax*Brand*Consumables** campaign instead? That’s one of two campaigns that hasn’t shown incremental revenue post-scaling. The other is **US*PMax*Brand*AllProducts**, but since that campaign was the most heavily scaled, adjusting TROAS there might risk ending the scaling test prematurely.  
Let me know what you think!
- **2025-07-16 21:28** *Jourdan*: Hey @Rahul Vithanage I’m aligned with your perspective on leaving Non-Brand SB campaign alone. The Consumables campaign is at a 2.71 L7 in platform with spend down 5% so what do you think will happen to the performance here?  
  
All products performance looks great so that campaign is rebounding compared to previous period and I wouldn’t want to mess with T ROAS.
- **2025-07-16 21:29** *Jourdan*: We’ve really got to push revenue so getting soft on spend isn’t ideal
- **2025-07-17 07:02** *Rahul Vithanage*: Got it Jourdan. In that case do you want to hold off on the TROAS scale given that it will certainly cause lower spend in whichever campaign we decide to implement it in? ROAS will likely improve but spend will certainly drop in that campaign, although, we can assess by how much it drops by, so we have some sort of a baseline. Let me know how you feel.
- **2025-07-17 13:30** *Jourdan*: Yeah i agree we should probably hold off on it for now. We should be done with the spend test tomorrow right?\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Rahul Vithanage*

- **2025-07-23 08:38** *Rahul Vithanage* 💬 1 reply: Hey @Jourdan, this is to confirm that the top revenue generating products on Google (L7D) shared on yesterday's call are also quite efficient in terms of a ROAS perspective.\n\n*Reactions: :raised_hands: Jourdan*

- **2025-07-23 12:02** *Rahul Vithanage*: thanks Jourdan
- **2025-07-23 16:27** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Jourdan wanted to follow up regarding GA4 tracking set up migration. Lmk if you have any updates for us :pray::skin-tone-4:
- **2025-07-23 16:29** *Jourdan*: Yo! I haven’t heard anything myself so will need to follow up in that thread you connected me in
- **2025-07-24 07:11** *Rahul Vithanage* 💬 1 reply: I think the first step is to get the Cardinal team (who isn't on that thread) to confirm if the current GA4 tracking configuration is tracking data accurately. Then you might need to connect Annatta and Cardinal so that Cardinal can remove the current GA4 tag set up while, simultaneously, Annatta implements the new set up by setting up the "Google & YouTube" app on Shopify.
- **2025-07-24 07:13** *Rahul Vithanage*: Let me know once you get to the point where the two teams are connecting for the tracking migration. Perhaps I myself can join the call to assist you guys as well.
- **2025-07-29 12:22** *Jourdan*: hey @Rahul Vithanage how are you feeling about the budget increases?
- **2025-07-29 12:22** *Jourdan*: For August
- **2025-07-30 06:26** *Rahul Vithanage*: Love it!! Thanks Jourdan :blush: Let me game plan where to allocate that spend towards. I also saw around 30k for Demand Gen so I think we are actually eligible to run a search lift / brand lift test. Let's discuss this with Tori today!
- **2025-07-30 12:04** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey Jourdan, are you able to make it to the Google call?
- **2025-07-30 12:04** *Jourdan*: Okay sweet and its actually still $15k with $15k going towards CTV\n\n*Reactions: :+1::skin-tone-4: Rahul Vithanage*
- **2025-07-30 12:05** *Jourdan*: and i wasn’t added to the invite
- **2025-07-30 12:05** *Jourdan*: when is the call?
- **2025-07-30 12:06** *Rahul Vithanage*: Ooops just added you Jourdan
- **2025-07-30 12:06** *Rahul Vithanage*: It's our call with our Google reps
- **2025-07-31 09:47** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey Jourdan! I added you to our weekly TBs with the Google reps starting this week, but since Tori owns the calendar invite, it looks like it didn’t go through on your end — which is probably why it didn’t show up on your calendar. I’ve just asked Tori to add you directly so you’re included in all upcoming TBs moving forward!
- **2025-07-31 09:47** *Rahul Vithanage*: My apologies about the call this week.
- **2025-07-31 10:30** *Rahul Vithanage*: Just to brief you on **yesterday's call:**  
• We discussed the need to **consolidate the fragmented search campaigns** (combining all Brand Search into one and combining all Non-Brand Search into one). This way we can consolidate budgets and be able to compete better in the auction house. Also one other benefit is that we can minimize overlap between campaigns potentially driving better efficiency. Lmk if you're aligned here and I can go ahead and make the changes.   
• Tori followed up on whether we're planning to test out **YouTube.** In our previous conversations with Ingrid, all of us agreed on the importance of running YT to build our funnel and drive new customer acquisition. Given the increased paid search budget for August and current Google pacing, we have the capacity to support YouTube. Currently clarifying next steps with Tori regarding budget and KPIs (you're cc'd on the email thread). Once everything is ironed out, I can launch this campaign.   
• Tori also wants to **incrementally keep scaling Demand Gen.** I'd like to hear your thoughts on this since the budget for Aug is $15k ($500/day) and we're currently at this budget. 
- **2025-07-31 14:07** *Jourdan*: Thanks for the update and getting me added!
- **2025-07-31 14:07** *Jourdan*: Hold off on Demand Gen scale. $15k is about all we have unless we can reallocate spend from Google in a few days if performance doesn’t stick\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Rahul Vithanage*
- **2025-07-31 14:07** *Jourdan*: Im aligned with testing YT but we need long form content
- **2025-07-31 14:08** *Jourdan*: So probably can get going with Shorts in the meantime\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Rahul Vithanage*
- **2025-07-31 14:08** *Jourdan* 💬 1 reply: and send through best practice for long form content on the channel so we can get briefs made and content produced
- **2025-07-31 14:08** *Jourdan*: or maybe we can repurpose organic videos?
- **2025-07-31 14:08** *Jourdan*: When you consolidate campaigns can you clearly label which products are in the ad groups or ads?
- **2025-07-31 14:09** *Jourdan* 💬 1 reply: I’ve built a report that tracks spend by product but the all products campaign takes up a large chunk of spend and doesn’t have clear labeling on products so there’s a big chunk of unattributed spend. I’m fine with consolidating but want more clarity on naming conventions if possible
- **2025-08-01 07:46** *Rahul Vithanage*: Hey @Jourdan, a quick thing on YouTube before we launch. If we allocate **$1000/day for 10 days,** we're **eligible for a brand and search lift study.** If this proves to be successful, we should continue this and convert it to an evergreen campaign. This would mean that the campaign will need **$30k in budget** in a given month. Are you okay if we utilize $30k from the paid search budget for this test in August? (We don't need to continue after 10 days if the test doesn't prove to be successful - if there's no lift). If you're okay, I can ask Tori to allowlist us for the lift test internally and launch the campaign afterwards, once everything is set.
- **2025-08-01 13:48** *Jourdan*: Ahh im not sure how I feel about spending that much that quickly on YT since it’s not a proven channel.
- **2025-08-01 13:48** *Jourdan*: I think we bring this to the larger group and ask
- **2025-08-01 13:49** *Jourdan*: I’m iffy on the value of the brand lift study at this stage with little spend on the channel
