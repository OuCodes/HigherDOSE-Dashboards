- **2025-03-10 14:02** *Ingrid*: I love this - so clear and helpful!
- **2025-03-10 14:02** *Ingrid*: very much looking forward to our continued chats on Thursday for more changes/optimizationg to make! more more mroe!
- **2025-03-10 14:03** *Chris Jacob*: @User_0Q2KDX what is being included in Sauna Products
- **2025-03-10 14:06** *Chris Jacob*: @User_0Q2KDX I received the dashboard that looks like below

- **2025-03-10 14:07** *Chris Jacob*: confirm that means 3rd through 9th of 2025? and if so can you provide the order list summing to those figures as I am unable to match them
- **2025-03-11 12:54** *Chris Jacob*: @User_0Q2KDX ^
- **2025-03-11 13:00** *User_0Q2KDX*: Hey @Chris Jacob, sorry for the limited availability as I'm on vacation till Thursday.  
It is 3rd through 9th of 25. I suggest that once we meet on Thursday we will go over the assumptions we use for: counting orders (without drafts), return rate, packing, picking, COGS and so on. I will ask someone from our team to join as well to explain it in details.

- **2025-03-17 12:43** *Chris Jacob*: @User*CFN3H9 @User*0Q2KDX I uploaded wrong file here but that one is also relevant so
- **2025-03-17 12:43** *Chris Jacob*: first

- **2025-03-17 12:43** *Chris Jacob*: this has per-unit main product cost/cogs in it i have not updated anything else
- **2025-03-17 12:43** *Chris Jacob*: for shipping costs by order can you deal with multiple line items and just do a version of sum? many orders have multiple packages
- **2025-03-17 12:44** *Chris Jacob*: or do we need a file that has a single freight cost for any given order
- **2025-03-18 10:10** *User_CFN3H9*: Hi @Chris Jacob we've updated the SKUs cost according to the updated file you shared with us, you can access it [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1balyx0Dz6q6o4dbJBD3QnwMBaXL8I7zboCq4NZGVsgo/edit?usp=sharing) (it will be reflected in the system tomorrow morning - after the nightly processing)  
Regarding the shipping costs per order - same as with the SKUs, we need an identifier and a cost.
- **2025-03-18 10:43** *Chris Jacob*: @User_CFN3H9 to clarify can I send multiple line items that reference the same shopify order number
- **2025-03-18 10:43** *Chris Jacob*: or just one per order
- **2025-03-18 16:38** *User_CFN3H9*: Thanks for the clarification @Chris Jacob!  
If I understand you correctly, you would like to attribute shipping costs by item within each order?  
Sure! We can get down to any granularity.  
If you can provide both order-id and sku/product/variant id - we can match the costs in the line item level (BTW - if line item id is available for you - we can match the costs based on this identifier alone).  
I hope I got you right this time :nerd_face: 
- **2025-03-19 08:52** *Chris Jacob*: @User_CFN3H9 confirm where you want this data provided to you?
- **2025-03-19 08:58** *User_CFN3H9*: Hey @Chris Jacob - I will generate a google-sheet for it.  
Which identifiers would you like to use? (line-item-id or order-id+sku)
- **2025-03-19 21:20** *Chris Jacob*: @User*CFN3H9 @User*0Q2KDX I've created attached follow up to today to outline skus, let me know questions, notes below  
1. Tech - all "normal" except FACENECK-V1 is only a cart upsell - so goes into revenue but should be ignore in contexts like conversion rate  
2. CPG - all normal except the cleaner refill exclude from contexts like conversion rate it's only bought by people seeking it out to refill CLEANERKIT  
3. For full saunas people can buy and add to cart like anything but many are sold "high touch" with sales rep and they put down a deposit and then pay balance.  Deposit + Balance = Full price but only one unit of inventory/cost  
• Related, I would likely exclude the full sauna PDP from things like conversion rate it's such a different item with extremely low direct conversion or normal web behavior (many people email in, they have to understand electrical hookups delivery etc etc)  
4. "Temporary Items" are either special promotion SKUS, special affiliate SKUs, limited time things, etc - it's nice to have things like conversion rate available if we inquire but I would not want them to "dilute" normal metrics because they would tend toward different buying behavior  
5. "Other Revenue Items Not on Site" are things that increase revenue but are not products sold on site like normal  
6. "Free Items" should be excluded from any work you do.  There is occasional some small revenue (we sometimes charge for a replacement controller) but these should have no influence on web metrics or anything else material

- **2025-03-19 21:28** *Chris Jacob*: @User_CFN3H9 we would want to provide the shopify order number #123456 and the $ figure  
  
Some orders will appear multiple times we can either include them all or sum them once
- **2025-03-20 13:48** *User_CFN3H9*: Sure @Chris Jacob - that would work :+1:  
In addition, as most probably we wouldn't have the shipping cost data in real-time, we need a default cost value for the missing order numbers (until actual data will be available).  
So please share:  
1. Default value to be used as order shipping cost for missing order numbers  
2. The shipping cost by order number file (if the full data isn't available yet, we can start with what you already have)  
Thanks :pray:
- **2025-03-25 10:11** *Chris Jacob*: @User_CFN3H9 to where shall I upload actual costs ?
- **2025-03-25 13:33** *User_CFN3H9*: Hey @Chris Jacob - you can share with me an excel / csv file, I'll generate a google sheet which we will update periodically. Does it work for you?  
BTW - if this data can be retrieved by API, we can look into pulling it automatically.

- **2025-04-11 09:57** *Chris Jacob*: this is an example of how we receive it comes in multiple tabs you will see shopify order numbers near beginning and then the total cost all the way to the right
- **2025-04-11 09:58** *Chris Jacob*: do you have the ability to easily pull from here or do we need to pull into a sheet that is just two columns
- **2025-04-11 09:58** *Chris Jacob*: with the previous note that many shopify orders end up having multiple line items over time (either when shipped in multiple boxes) (or, there are correction charges that come later increasing the cost)
- **2025-04-14 10:19** *User_CFN3H9* 💬 10 replies: Hey @Chris Jacob,  
We can work on processing the shipping-costs file as is - it will just take more time to complete (it is not just the multiple sheets it is also blank rows, missing order-ids etc.)  
Regarding the multiple lines per order - please define a logic to cover such cases and we'll implement it.  
Lastly - we should define how would you share these excels with us (+all history)  
Sounds OK to you?
- **2025-04-14 22:10** *User_CFN3H9*: Hi @Ingrid / @User_D9M53N - we need a one-time Facebook token renewal from your end.  
The process is super simple and takes like a minutes.  
You should log on to the system and then:\n\n📎 **image.png** (png, 216.7KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T030ZE3K0UV-F08NHLU8JD7/image.png)

    - **2025-08-01 07:33** *Rahul Vithanage*: ↳ I was actually referring to consolidating search campaigns Jourdan - one primary campaign for brand and another for non-brand vs. having multiple. This way we can combine budgets which are currently fragmented and enter the auction house more competitively with higher budgets.  
    Regarding product performance, are you referring to a report that you created on Google?
