# TODO List

## Organizing

- [x] Add the transcript to the repo
- [x] Ground the context file in the transcript
- [x] Add transcript to repository and set up system for future transcript processing
- [ ] As we accomplish certain goals, we should move them from the comprehensive context.md file to a specific timestamped markdown file in the @/notes folder.

## Scripting

- [ ] Add utility scripts to the repo
- [ ] Add logging to the slack converter script
- [ ] Create a home for the slack script and the slack json exports. We need a home folder for the py script to scan and keep track of which json files have already been converted. Cleaner than leaving it in the root directory.
