Hey @Jourdan, [here's the sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13_8Qp8uECRBg3T0wxocgl0mMlWpPLjydwduFLtHbwkw/edit?usp=sharing) which includes the most recently concluded search copy a/b test results. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks! cc: @Abigale @Ari Murray @Ingrid

**Jourdan** (2025-07-03 11:21:14):
Thank you @Rahul can you add me to the Wed meeting next week w/ the reps?

**Jourdan** (2025-07-03 11:22:49):
Good work on this too btw. Looks like you guys created a winning iteration for every ad group over that timeline

**Jourdan** (2025-07-03 11:24:33):
Looks like the old ads were paused from what i see in the columns so the winning variants are getting the majority of spend from increasing?

**Jake Panzer** (2025-07-03 11:30:09):
Hey @Jourdan @Ingrid- just wanted to note we plan on getting those attribution windows of the legacy campaigns changed before the holiday weekend as discussed!

**Jourdan** (2025-07-03 11:31:20):
Okay thank you for following up. Can we also launch a single product campaign for Red Light Hat ?

**Jourdan** (2025-07-03 11:31:32):
Just to kick off in that direction then optimize the account over time to single product camps

**Jourdan** (2025-07-03 13:01:00):
Hey @Rahul I’m projecting July performance and reviewing the account. I’m curious about some of the TROAS settings for PMAX campaigns.  I see the All Products campaign is set to 400% can you help me understand what determines the targets?

**Abigale** (2025-07-03 15:53:32):
Hi team! Noting that we are out of office tomorrow in celebration of the 4th but we will be staying close all weekend as needed. Please let us know if you have any flags from your end in the meantime, we hope you enjoy your holiday weekend! cc @Jake Panzer

**Elyse** (2025-07-07 14:56:04):

**1DC NB L7**
**Spend: $6,200**
**Revenue: $804**
**ROAS: .13** (-35.58%)
**CAC: $3,100 (+30.90%)** 
Updates and next steps
• The body sculpt focused funnel has started off well both in platform and in NB.
    ◦ In platform: 4.54 ROAS $73 CAC
    ◦ NB clicks only: .68 ROAS 
    ◦ Awareness metrics: 62.3% LP view rate, .72 CPC. We will look to refresh this campaign to keep driving these metrics 
• In the pipeline is our full high aov product funnel
    ◦ We'll launch this if body sculpt falls off/budget supports!
Traffic campaigns in June (Roughly 12% of spend this week)
• .35 CPC, 1.56% CTR and a Landing page view rate 66.14%
[Creative Report](https://projects.motionapp.com/snapshot/1c57f4ef-091a-473c-9802-ac496beffacb)
• 027 V4 is our top performer in platform and on NB. The sound and text overlay are both key factors here. The background sound is consistent in the top performing body sculpt creatives

Hey @Ingrid and @Chris Jacob, sharing through our **search impression share and CPC insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms.

**Core Brand - Screenshot 1**
• Defending brand terms very well with an impression share consistently over 90%, over the last 8+ weeks.
• [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) have increased impression share over the last 4 weeks, indicating higher bidding on our brand terms. 
**Sauna Blanket (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 2**
• Defending market share well - still the market leader. [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) is our main competitor in the space. 
• CPCs seem to be normalizing over the last 3 weeks, showcasing a slow return to an evergreen state
**Red Light Hat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 3**
• Market leaders [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) have seen a significant drop in impression share over the last 2 weeks. Possibly due to scaling down drastically post promos. Showcases a need to scale significantly during sale periods to remain competitive with them.
• Competitors like [schoolofdermatology.com](http://schoolofdermatology.com) and [omniluxled.com](http://omniluxled.com) have managed to improve their share in the space and a new competitor has entered the auction house ([hoogahealth.com](http://hoogahealth.com)) 
• We want to scale this campaign by 20% this week to assess if we can capture some additional impression share, traffic and conversions. 
**PEMF Mat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 4**
• We remain market leaders in the space despite scaling down drastically in June. This indicates strong performance during evergreen periods. We also recently launched new ad copy under the PEMF ad group aimed at improving quality scores and impression share which seems to be working well in defending our share. 
• [magnawavepemf.com](http://magnawavepemf.com) remains our biggest competitor in the space. 
• CPCs are dropping / stabilizing, indicating a slow return to an evergreen state. 
Let us know if you have any questions :relaxed: cc: @Berkeley Clark @Ari Murray

**Rahul** (2025-07-10 09:20:12):
Hey @Ingrid (cc: @Jourdan), we met with our Google rep Tori yesterday and here’s what we aligned on—sharing for visibility:
• We’ll let the **Pmax scaling test** run for 30 days (from June 19 until July 18), then scale down any campaigns that aren’t driving incremental revenue post scale.
 • On July 12 (after Prime Day), we’ll **increase the target ROAS** on one Pmax campaign by +15% and monitor for around 2 weeks before deciding whether to roll this out to other campaigns.
 • **Demand Gen scaling to $500/day** will realistically need about 6 weeks for proper learning according to Tori. Let us know if you guys are down to up the budget to $500/day from the current $300/day.
 • Waiting on Tori to confirm what the **ToF YT Reach/Traffic investment** will look like.

Hey @Jourdan and team, our Shopping campaign has had a bit of drop off in spends and revenue recently, so I did a little digging and noticed that *bundles* were the primary cause. I believe the bundle images which are synced to GMC showcases the evergreen offer, and because of this, GMC has disapproved those SKUs as promotional imagery is not allowed in Google Shopping placements. Would you guys be able to provide [rahul@sharmabrands.com](mailto:rahul@sharmabrands.com) and [berkeley@sharmabrands.com](mailto:berkeley@sharmabrands.com) admin access to your GMC, and also provide us alternate image links for each bundle that's live on-site, which doesn't showcase the offer?
Thanks in advance!

**Chris Jacob** (2025-07-10 13:05:41):
I've added access

**Chris Jacob** (2025-07-10 13:05:48):
@Sumish Khadka do you have the legacy images without the promo

**Ingrid** (2025-07-10 15:22:38):
@Chris Jacob let me look

**Ingrid** (2025-07-10 15:35:11):
confirming we don't have them without the discounts but I've asked Dani to take if off and send me a fresh batch - will share here

**Ingrid** (2025-07-10 15:35:41):
unrelated - @Berkeley Clark can we please make sure there are no Hyperrice bundles in ads?

**Chris Jacob** (2025-07-11 08:14:15):
FYI we had a sale on Nordstrom for sauna blankets which sold 150 units over the past three days so maybe some effect on DTC

**Jeremy Dranikoff** (2025-07-11 11:38:34):
Hey @Jourdan happy Friday! Please see [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i0FND-8p7CjiRzOjRk0AFC7nRfWXxWwSbYZHzLhYf1A/edit?usp=sharing) for our Tiktok relationship to the other channels and business as a whole. Happy to pull anymore numbers and explain this further anytime. Definitely some interesting insights here! We are prepared to take action on turning off the SPC and launching a red light mask specific funnel, but decided to hold for feedback. Let us know what you think. Thank you and have a great weekend! CC @Berkeley Clark

**Ingrid** (2025-07-11 13:19:21):
excuse me for stating the obvious but we are also on the last day of prime week (4 days this year) so that would also account for slowness in the DTC front

**Chris Jacob** (2025-07-11 13:29:00):
fyi both mask and red light starter kit got pulled from tt shop compliance working to restore

**Ingrid** (2025-07-12 14:38:23):
Bundle images with no promo sticker here!
