Hi Team,

Thank you for the time today - it is always so much fun to be together in
person! Looking forward to carrying that forward as we head into H2!

Billy and I will be in Kansas City with another customer until next
Wednesday. However, we have availability on Thursday and Friday of next
week to meet and discuss lower funnel refinement. Please let us know which
day and time works best for the team and I’ll send over an invite!

I have made an initial list of follow up “homework” for each team to keep
us honest until I have a working Joint Business Plan for us to all work
against. Please let me know if there are any additional items you'd like to
include.

*Google Team:*

- YouTube Creative Audit
- Summer of testing timeline


*HigherDOSE Team:*

- Scale existing PMAX budgets to capitalize on incredible performance
from the month
- Implement NCA goals within PMAX campaigns
- Collect creative to be reviewed by the YT Creative Services team
- Grant Google access to Northbeam


SO excited for continued success and collaboration between our teams! Enjoy
all your days off tomorrow! Talk soon!

Cheers,
