## Body

Hey Chris and Ingrid,

We already exclude the following:

*

*Draft Orders (and their returns):*

We remove any sales that originated as Shopify Draft Orders. Accordingly, we also exclude any returns related to those excluded Draft Orders. In other words, if the original sale was excluded because it was a Draft Order, the corresponding return is also excluded.

*

*Specific line items:*

We exclude line items in the following categories:

*

Extend Service Contract

*

Gift Card

*

Gift

*

Insurance

*

Shipping Protection

Regarding ShopMy Cookbook program:

The discounts applied here reflect actual transactions. However, if preferred, we can also exclude them.

The P-OAS table without this discount key is shown below:
