Ad-vetorials for each of our products

## Body

Hey Jourdan and Elyse,

Wanted to connect you both here to help work on creating some ad-vetorials
for each of our products. Jourdan, you can show Elyse what these look like
from your previous days, but it's a combination of a shoppable page and a
blog post that we would push out into paid media.

Let me know how I can help but think you guys can take it from here. I'd of
course like you to share your thoughts/plan with me when you're ready -
perhaps we aim for week of July 7 to review?

Thanks,
Ingrid
