Hi Anastasia and Jourdan,

Great to connect with you today! Excited to get this partnership launched
(and I can justify adding to my HigherDose collection)!

Following our call, I'm including a link to the deck we reviewed HERE
<[trk.joincheckmate.com](https://trk.joincheckmate.com/e3t/Ctc/W3+23284/d2rnDQ04/JjT5m-BpW50kH_H6lZ3kYN33S9zHR3WVhW3JbhX37-_ttVW6dw6VM5q4LWsVhCpXK61kV2jW1Gsg7g6CbgNRW7JVmXz6KBTqzVtsrqH8mt5ykW2MsJmQ59tqD_W7LgXvk2nVlfVW7J4FP35Zf1vsW3yX8sY5B0xDpN63NV9SkfZTtW7lHbmX56rMbJN7nxDQwNC1z0W76Dz604MW1L-W6-62xl6TftXwW3sVB4Y29wT_KW1myhwg2-9hPfW8n_1SN8zFlzYV7XMDd7k1B59W4d1lsw5gvsQRW5cnQTF2Mq_70N2cNH1rXbYXzW28sQgZ7tTs_3W6G8-Tp3FJDJMW8znrzw5JQXVfVgBcGy7RmYLZW7fcnjj7XjZ4CW2qPlkq5bwznmW6rX9lt982qbpW8S76nH3Srwt6W3K5yGP66sz8Lf4sGPtb04>)

Next Steps:

- Please follow Checkmate Targeting Onboarding Instructions (AWIN)
<[trk.joincheckmate.com](https://trk.joincheckmate.com/e3t/Ctc/W3+23284/d2rnDQ04/Jks2-6qcW69sMD-6lZ3mDW24PS8h84zK7wW47PT7X7QCKjcW5GkqQl8jbrZ0W3nx9318Q4wFJW2hf-nj46fDc_W88Nmbw3CfT9RW7_vHL26khZCgVdrKZq51DGP8N3H79WnJ6tjLW3BTptn50pbzHVG_2cM2SJQWzW7f02QR3Dgr6SW3nlG4K7Yg23zW4m64dN9f05-JW1JShKz47306MW2w9PlD4X8QBQN1RcxllXz-0_Vt7rtp5BVf17W3st1fG9htS-WW3T9qyf85f9LVf2Hhpj404>)
- Once completed, we'll set the campaign amount to 10% off offer for
Checkmate Targeting.

I have our onboarding and customer success wizard, Shounak, copied here in
case there are any questions regarding onboarding.

Looking forward to working with you all!

All the best,
Spencer
