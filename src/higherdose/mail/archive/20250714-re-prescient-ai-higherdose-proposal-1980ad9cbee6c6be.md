Re: Prescient AI <> Higherdose [Proposal]

## Body

Sounds good, Ingrid.

Lauren - I've sent over the Order Form to via DocuSign. Per their request
of Sumish, I've update the opt-out from 6 months to 5 months, and
maintained the initial discount we discussed via SB.

Looking forward to the partnership.

Best,
Mike
