## Body

Hi Ingrid and Jourdan,
Amazing news and so happy to meet you, Jourdan! We'll get our docs packaged
up and excited to hit the ground running together. On the Slack side, @Ingrid
Milman Cordy  we're not able to add HD members to
our joint channels so would need your support there when you have a moment.
Looking forward to our Monday smaller group and Jourdan we'll reach out now
on email under separate cover to coordinate a 1:1 between Jake, Berkeley,
you, and me for next week. Can't wait.
Thank you so much,
Ari
Ari Murray 
Chief Growth Officer,
