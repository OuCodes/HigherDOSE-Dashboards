Hey Anastasia,

Thanks for sending this over. I am curious about how they get paid. It
shows $149/month + 15% CPA which I'm not sure if they're taking 15% of the
average CPA driven so more clarity on that would be nice.

I think its worth having a conversation with them to figure out more.

Thank you,
