| |  | | --- | | Hi HigherDOSE Shop! | | Are you looking to sell products from two or more brands? We've just introduced a new **Co-Branding/Licensing** submission option for brand authorization in **Seller Center**. | | If this applies to your shop, we recommend submitting your co-branding or licensing documents to ensure compliance and unlock benefits — like the Authorized Seller badge on your listings. | |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| |  | | --- | | **What does the Co-Branding/Licensing option do?** | |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| |  | | --- | | * You can sell products created in collaboration with two or more brands * You can hold official licensing agreements to use another brand's intellectual property | |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| |  | | --- | | **What are the next steps?** | | If you **DON'T** have the necessary rights to list the products, please remove the affected listings to avoid further violations. | | If you **DO** have valid licensing or co-branding agreements, submit your documentation using the following steps: | | 1. Go to **Seller Center** then to **My Account** 2. Click **Account** **Settings** 3. Then click**Qualification Center** 4. Go to**Brand Authorization** 5. Under the **Brand qualification** tab, click "Add brand authorization" 6. Select the **Co-Branding/Licensing** option | | Or you can click the button below to be taken there directly. | | |  | | --- | | [Submit Co-Branding/Licensing Documents](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ7v7tH4xLtn) | | |
