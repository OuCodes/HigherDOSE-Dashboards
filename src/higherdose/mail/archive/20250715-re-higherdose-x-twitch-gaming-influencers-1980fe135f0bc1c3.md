Hey Anastasia! Love to hear it. I am traveling starting Tuesday (Moving
cross country to Boston) so Monday the 21st between 9am-12pm PST is best.
However, I can have my team lead the call Tuesday -Thursday between
9am-12pm PST if that's better for you. You'll be in great hands!

Let me know and I'll lock uis in with an invite :)

Cheers,
Tommy
