## Body

Hey Anastasia and Jourdan,

Exciting news! HigherDOSE is live on Checkmate Targeting with a 10% off
campaign!

As for next steps, I'm working with our social team to get the following
placements for HigherDOSE:

- In-app merchant page customization
- Homepage carousel featured tile
- 1x Push Notification + in app notification dedicated
- 2x IG story social feature with link to shop

Reporting will be found within your Checkmate Shopify app and I will be in
touch to confirm the brand placements/features.

Excited to be working with you!

All the best,
Spencer
