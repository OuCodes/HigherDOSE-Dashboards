Hi Anastasia,

Sharing a quick note. Kelly mentioned you might be a solid fit for what
we’ve been doing with brands like HOBO Bags and Little Beast.

Inspired reduces the need for deep discounting by using charitable
incentives (funded entirely by a network of major donors) that boost
checkout rates while protecting your profit margins. There’s no cost to you
or the shopper.

Try this instead of a 20% off: 15% to the shopper, 5% to a cause they care
about. That 5% donation keeps your margins safe.

Open to a short call to explore?

Best,
Stephen Ready
Co-Founder & CEO
Inspired

Hi Stephen

Saw that HigherDOSE is using Shopify – could be a fit for the same approach
we used with NOBULL, Florence by Mills, etc.

Anastasia Klaffert or Sumish Khadka is probably the right person for this:
anastasia@higherdose.com.

Let’s get in touch.
