Hey Jourdan,

Why do some ads just stick in your brain?

Even if they don't have the best copy or most engaging visuals, hours later you catch yourself thinking about them.

The secret is tension.

Not the Love Island kind of tension, cognitive tension. The kind that happens when your brain encounters incomplete information or unresolved questions. Your mind literally can't let it go until the loop is closed.

This week, we're diving into the mental mechanics behind irresistible ads:

- Why your ads should create tension
- Why you need to resolve that tension
- How to open and close the loop (with examples)

Ready to understand what makes ads psychologically sticky?

The science of unfinished business

In the 1920s, psychologist Kurt Lewin noticed the wait staff at a busy café could remember complex orders with perfect accuracy.

However, as soon as they delivered the food and collected payment, they couldn't recall a single detail about what they'd just served.

Fellow psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik ran a series of experiments to figure out why.

Turns out, our brains hold onto unfinished or interrupted tasks much better than completed ones – this is called the Zeigarnik effect.

Incomplete information stays active in our working memory, demanding attention and mental resources.

Why we crave closure

The last psychologist I’ll mention is George Loewenstein, who found that curiosity is triggered when we perceive a gap between what we know and what we want to know. But the gap must be:

- Visible: We need to sense there's something missing.
- Relevant: It must feel important or personally meaningful.
- Close-able: We believe we can easily find or get the answer.

If the gap is too wide, we disengage ("this is too hard to figure out"). If it's too small, there's no intrigue. But when the gap is just right, our brain releases dopamine to drive us toward filling it.

So essentially, giving our audience incomplete information creates psychological tension, making them pay more attention to us and motivating them to click the ad and learn more.

These are both big wins for advertisers, but there is some risk involved.

The emotional aftermath

If you’re going to create tension for your customer, you need to make sure you’re resolving it as well.

Creating and then resolving tension gives your audience a sense of relief, which transfers that positive emotional payoff to your brand.

The flip side is that failing to resolve tension will damage your credibility and frustrate your audience.

When you create tension without resolving it, you’re tricking people into clicking your ad. It’s a frustrating experience as a shopper, and while they will probably remember your brand – they won’t remember it fondly.

There are a few ways you can resolve tension.

Resolve within the ad

This is the most common way to resolve tension, probably because it’s the simplest.

Your hook creates tension with a vague statement or bold claim, then the rest of your ad explains the hook. This ad from Grüns is a great example – they start with a bold statement “your probiotics might not be working” and then go on to explain why.

Simple, engaging, hooks the viewer.

Resolve with a landing page

We don’t just want people to watch our ads, right? We want them to click our ads. When you resolve tension within an ad, the loop closes before they’ve clicked through.

What if we use our ads to create tension, but they have to visit our landing page to resolve it? This gives the audience more reason to click through and get a step closer to converting.

Here's an example from Lumē deodorant  that nails it. It creates tension with incomplete information, but the information is still specified – we’re offering a discount but we can’t tell you what the discount is.

You have to click through to the landing page to see the discount. You know how to close the information gap and you know it’s pretty easy, so if you’re interested in the product you’re going to click through.

My one complaint is they’re bleeping out a word in the hook, and while I have some guesses, the landing page doesn’t confirm anything. I doubt this hurts performance but I want to know!

Resolve with a demo

What if a landing page isn’t right for your product?

I found this ad from Owner.com that builds tension with just a static. That’s a big number and a strong hook, I’m curious how they did it.

I clicked through hoping to read a case study, but was instead met with a form to book a demo.

At first, I didn’t like this. I just wanted to read a case study. But I’m not in the target demographic, so this isn’t relevant to me. I wouldn’t book a demo anyway since I don’t run a restaurant.

If it was relevant to me, this would be a great way to roll curiosity into getting demos booked. Just make sure your sales team knows the case study the ad refers to if you're going to run something like this.

Every week, we feature an AI task you can run in Motion chosen by our own creative strategy expert, Alysha Boehm.

🔎 Identify My Target Personas - Mirella

Ever feel like you’re flying blind on who your ads are actually resonating with? You’ve got performance data, but not much insight into the humans behind the clicks. That’s where this task comes in.

It analyzes the contents of your ads — visuals, copy, age and gender data — and returns four data-backed personas your creative is currently attracting. You’ll get detailed breakdowns of who they are, what matters to them, and what kind of content converts them.

It’s incredibly useful when you need to decide which persona to build your next round of creative for. Sometimes, you’ll uncover an audience you didn’t even realize you were reaching. That surprise persona? It might be your next big unlock.

Use it when you need clearer direction, sharper targeting, or a fresh take on who your creative should speak to next.

Tying it all together 🧵

This week’s Thumbstop focused on a fundamental truth about human psychology: we're drawn to incomplete stories and unresolved questions.

By creating the right type of tension you can make your ads psychologically compelling. You just have to check all three boxes:

- Visible
- Relevant
- Close-able

Now, go create some tension! (Just in your ads though.)
