Help Needed: CTV/OTT Creative Development

## Body

Hey team,

We are getting much more serious about our testing in the CTV channel and I
need your help in getting us ready with amazing and beautiful content.

Jourdan - will you please gather each of the potential partner's specs
(MNTN, YouTube, TVScientific) and put together a brief with Laura on
content needs.

Laura - please spend a little time combing through all our video content
(Sharma has done this too, I believe) and figure out what we have and what
we still need so I can plan shoots accordingly. I'd suggest pulling Margo
and/or Dani in to help as well.

Sharma - would love your involvement and guidance here given you've done
this before with other clients.

I'll leave you all here to connect, @Jourdan Smith
<jourdan@higherdose.com> please
be the ringleader of this workflow - I'd like to have a status chat
next week (Thursday?)

Thanks team!
