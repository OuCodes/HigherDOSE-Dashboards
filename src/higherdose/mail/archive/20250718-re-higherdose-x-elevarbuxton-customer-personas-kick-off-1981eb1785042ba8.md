## Body

Hey Claudia,

I just booked time with you on July 25th at 9:30AM CST which both
Ingrid and I show as available but It's very early for her.

We may reschedule for the following week but she's OOO until Tuesday so if
any changes are necessary I will follow up.

I look forward to speaking with you!

Thank you,
