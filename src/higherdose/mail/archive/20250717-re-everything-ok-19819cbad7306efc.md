Re: Everything ok?

## Body

Thank you for having grace and for the candid conversation today. I really
appreciate your trust and the opportunity to reset.

I hear you clearly on the need to be more available, proactive, and
consistent in my presence, especially in day-to-day management and partner
engagement.

I’ll also make sure to flag any situations where I may be pulled away from
daily operations so we can plan effectively and avoid disruptions.

While you’re traveling, I’ll make it a priority to:

-

Monitor daily sales and spend closely,
-

Identify and act on optimization opportunities to move us toward YoY
growth,
-

Maintain strong, ongoing communication with Sharma, Bark AI, Laura, and
other partners.
