There is no monthly fee - they will waive it for us.
They work through our affiliate platform and receive a 15% commission on
all sales they generate. It's a month-to-month thing, so we can cancel
anytime. I've had a few conversations with them already, but Ingrid wants
you to look into it as well. I'd be happy to set up another call with them.

Best,
Anastasia
