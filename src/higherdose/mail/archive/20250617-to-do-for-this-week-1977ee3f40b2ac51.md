To-do for This Week

## Body

Hey Jourdan,

Thanks for catching up yesterday! Wanted to make sure you had a clear list
of things to do this week while I'm traveling at this offsite. Let me know
if you have any questions.

1) Paid Media Audit: Year to Date (compared to previous) and Q2 to Date
- What channels are working hard for us that we need to continue investing
in?
- What channels have potential that we haven't fully unlocked yet?
- How can we start to efficiently "fill the funnel" in prep for Q4 with our
Q3 investments?
- Review our structure, efficiency measurement approach and suggest things
we Stop, Continue, and Test as we evolve

2) Get to know our products and how they work and analyze our ads creative
Jess sent over our product education decks - they are amazing resources for
helping you determine if our ads are doing a good enough job conveying
those benefits

3) Connect with Laura on creative content briefing - work on a timeline,
process and workflow together to make sure you guys are working together to
make it the process fast and efficient and meeting our frequent content
needs.

That should be plenty for the rest of the week - but let me know if you
have questions or get through this sooner. Also remember we are off for
Juneteeth on Thursday. I'll setup time for us to reconnect Monday after the
Sharma call.

Thanks!
Ingrid
