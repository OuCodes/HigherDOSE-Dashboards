## Body

Hey Ingrid,

Here’s a quick snapshot of Demand Gen MTD (June 8–29):

- Spend: $8,673.51
- CPM: $11.41 ($9.42 in ToF ad group)
- Conversions (platform comparable): 23
- CPA (platform comparable): $377.11
- Revenue (platform comparable): $13,494.45
- ROAS (platform comparable): 1.56
- View-through conversions: 1,551

Results for the launch month look promising. As we move into July, we’ll be
refining our Demand Gen/YouTube setup after syncing with our Google reps.
Note: "Platform comparable" metrics reflect attribution similar to paid
social, and Google reps suggest this gives a truer view of Demand Gen
performance.
For June, we worked with a $9K budget ($300/day). Let us know what budget
can be allocated for July.

Best,
Rahul
