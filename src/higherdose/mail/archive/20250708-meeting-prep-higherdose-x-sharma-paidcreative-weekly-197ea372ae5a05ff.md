Weekend sales strategies proved effective with a 53% increase in ROAS and a 42% decrease in CAC compared to weekdays. The Serotonin Soaked Salt product achieved a remarkable 6.3% click-to-purchase rate, outpacing Body Sculpt's 2.5%. The Body Sculpt campaign had a $1,300 spend, under $350 CAC, and a 2% click-through rate, exceeding account averages. After scaling on June 19, Google ads saw a notable increase in impressions and clicks, although conversions declined, indicating the need for strategic adjustments. The Demand Gen campaign launched on June 8 generated $13,494 in revenue from a $9,005 spend, and a TikTok strategy shift led to a promising 25 cost-per-click. Planning for July targets a 2.1 ROAS with a focus on Q4 preparation through creative testing. |  |  |  | | --- | --- | | ![]([files.fireflies.ai](https://files.fireflies.ai/email-templates/img/checkbox-2x.png)) | Action Items |  | Jake Panzer * Update customer lists for retention campaigns using CRM and Klaviyo access. * Switch Engage View attribution to standard seven-day click, one-day view for legacy campaigns. * Provide creative performance insights and recommendations for upcoming briefing calls. * Join Friday creative briefing calls at 9am PST starting next week. | | * Add Jake to bi-weekly creative briefing calls and coordinate pre-meeting check-ins. * Text Ingrid and Jordan about meeting attendance. | | * Schedule meeting with Google reps this week to discuss scaling performance and attribution discrepancies. * Create PMAX campaign dedicated to bundles with summer messaging. * Pull creative report for Demand Gen showing top and mid-funnel performance learnings. * Evaluate new search ad copy performance in 30 days and share results report. | | * Review July assumptions and sales goals with realistic efficiency targets. * Schedule awareness/top-of-funnel budget planning session for Monday with Ari and Jordan. * Coordinate with team on CTV campaign development and creative asset preparation. | | Ari Murray * Participate in Monday session for experimental budget allocation planning. * Explore CTV platform options that can create commercials from existing assets. | | * Connect sidebar about July forecast adjustments. * Determine flash sale backup strategy for July targets. | | |
