These updates make clarifications that address legal obligations and do not change the way we collect and process your data. Here’s a summary of the changes and some additional information on why these changes are being made:  Your Privacy and Data Obligations. We added a section to the MAA to ensure continued compliance with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Justice Data Security Program with respect to any government-related data or bulk U.S. sensitive personal data that you receive from Microsoft.  The updated Microsoft Advertising Agreement will take effect on July 8, 2025. Please make sure you read the updated Agreement carefully. Using Microsoft Advertising after the changes become effective means you accept the changes; if you don’t accept, you must stop using Microsoft Advertising.  Thank you for using Microsoft Advertising. | | |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | | --- | --- | | |  | | --- | | Sincerely,  Your Microsoft Advertising Support Team | | |  |  | | --- | |  | | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | | [**LinkedIn**]([t135.microsoftadvertising.microsoft.com](https://t135.microsoftadvertising.microsoft.com/r/?id=h151547e8,1314d449,13153cb5&e=b2NpZD0&s=dfR9J3GpT2D7G2kLnvrRj1m9raiV0EvYx9OncMJ1T_k) "LinkedIn") | | --- | |  |  | | [**Instagram**]([t135.microsoftadvertising.microsoft.com](https://t135.microsoftadvertising.microsoft.com/r/?id=h151547e8,1314d449,13153cb6&e=b2NpZD0&s=xBUYcKzAdmX1fMxp-0tDSXlPX8Nj0ZYylnhFJPhdYk0) "Instagram") | | --- | |  |  | | [**YouTube**]([t135.microsoftadvertising.microsoft.com](https://t135.microsoftadvertising.microsoft.com/r/?id=h151547e8,1314d449,13153cb7&e=b2NpZD0&s=6gc82jG2juyd9wZLnyXBEQ5hhSiD8qC_qDap2hxhPyU) "YouTube") | | --- | |  |  | | [**RSS**]([t135.microsoftadvertising.microsoft.com](https://t135.microsoftadvertising.microsoft.com/r/?id=h151547e8,1314d449,13153cb8&e=b2NpZD0&s=tpOsEM9cMu2hKg2aN7X7oN0nDYttzhO9p8Ey2bW9FXo) "RSS") | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | |  | | |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | --- | |  | | Please do not reply to this email, which was sent from an unmonitored mailbox.
