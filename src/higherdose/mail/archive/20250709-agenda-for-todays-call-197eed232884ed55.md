Agenda for Today's Call

## Body

Hey Tori,

Reaching out with today's agenda:

*Scaling Test:*

- Confirm next steps on the scaling test.
- Our POV is that we allow 30D in full (Jun 19 - Jul 18), then scale
down Pmax campaigns that aren’t driving incremental revenue.

*Target ROAS Increase:*

- We want to raise the target ROAS floor to 4–4.5.
- Can we make this change now? It’s important for us to be efficient
while pushing spend.

*Demand Gen / YT Budget:*

- If we scale to $500, how long do we realistically need to test for
accurate learnings?
- We also need to run a ToF YT campaign—how do we manage budget
allocation across both? Perhaps 70% to ToF and 30% to MoF?

Looking forward to our discussion today.

Best,
Rahul.
