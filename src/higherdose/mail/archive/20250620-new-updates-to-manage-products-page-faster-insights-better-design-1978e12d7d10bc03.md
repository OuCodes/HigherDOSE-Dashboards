| |  | | --- | | Dear TikTok Shop seller, We're excited to announce a completely redesigned **[Manage Products](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ7lKCO4dOJ7)** page in Seller Center, built to make your experience faster, clearer, and more efficient. 🆕 **What’s new?**  **✨  Improve seller experience** : A more intuitive *Manage Products* layout that was grounded in seller feedback and testing.  **🔴** **Spot****violations instantly** : Violations are now prominently marked with a red dot, with clear explanations provided. This makes it easier for sellers to identify and address issues promptly.  **📈 Monitor product performance** : GMV, units sold, and product views are now displayed directly in *Manage Products* page, giving sellers quick access to performance insights without leaving the page.  **💲 Drive growth with smarter task cards** : Task cards are powered by in-house data and algorithms and can help improve GMV when sellers complete the suggested actions. We've built this update with you in mind, so you can spend less time navigating tools and more time growing your business. Check out our [feature guide](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ7lKCO4uRLe) to explore everything that's new. Best,  TikTok Shop | |
