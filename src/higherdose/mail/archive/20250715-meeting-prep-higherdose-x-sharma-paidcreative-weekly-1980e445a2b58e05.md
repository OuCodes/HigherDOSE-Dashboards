Total sales reached $266K, exceeding the revised goal of $190K by 11.5%, with expenditures totaling $74.6K across various platforms. The Meta account is transitioning to product-specific campaigns, with a noted recovery in the Dr. Cabral campaign achieving a 1.1 one-day click ROAS. Applovin's Average Order Value (AOV) increased 36% week-over-week to $554, indicating a need for targeted strategies for older demographics. Google PMAX scaling has begun, increasing spend by 50%, resulting in a 20% growth in impressions but no conversion improvements yet. Key states for performance included California, Texas, Arizona, New York, and Florida, with untapped potential in Arizona, Utah, and Colorado. Effective messaging has been identified as problem-solution, particularly using user-generated content, while concerns about TikTok's rising CAC and declining ROAS were raised. Demand Gen metrics showed a promising return on investment. |  |  |  | | --- | --- | | ![]([files.fireflies.ai](https://files.fireflies.ai/email-templates/img/checkbox-2x.png)) | Action Items |  | Jake Panzer * Send year-to-date and June creative performance review filtered by top-performing evergreen content with minimum spend threshold. * Coordinate with Jordan on Meta product feed management and dynamic sets monitoring. | | * Meet with Google rep Tori to discuss scaling test timeline and target ROAS optimization. * Coordinate one-on-one meeting with Jeremy regarding TikTok CAC concerns. * Collaborate on Meta product feed cleanup and URL mapping for new campaign structure. | | * Discuss with Google rep Tori: 30-day scaling test timeline, target ROAS setup, demand gen budget increase to $500, and bundles PMAX campaign. * Provide placement breakdown for demand gen campaign showing YouTube, Gmail, and Discover performance. * Research and propose Arizona/Colorado geo-targeting campaign strategies. | | * Share spreadsheet with Jake for Meta campaign product mapping and bundle strategy. * Coordinate with Abigail on Body Sculptor UGC content focusing on trap muscle relief use case. | | Abigale Coleman * Deliver Red Light Face Mask UGC content currently in development. * Develop Body Sculptor content for work-from-home trap muscle relief angle. * Adjust meeting structure to accommodate Jeremy's schedule by moving TikTok updates earlier. | | |
