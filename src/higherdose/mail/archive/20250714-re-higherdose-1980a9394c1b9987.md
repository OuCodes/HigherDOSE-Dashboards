Hi Anastasia,

Very excited to build a relationship with tvscientific! The highlighted section below means that you do not need to complete the tech questions below if you would like to move forward with Awin’s Mastertag. Typically, implementing with the Mastertag is the easiest way to integrate.

Best,
Kylie

Hi Morgan,

Amazing! I was just about to email you our numbers. Appreciate the update!

Let me know if those metrics are still needed at this stage; otherwise, we’re ready and excited to get this test up and running.

Our standard AWIN commission rate is 10%, and Kylie can ensure everything is set up correctly from a tracking and tagging standpoint. Happy to fine-tune as we go.
Working on content as I type, excited to get this launched!

Best,
Anastasia

Hi Anastasia & team,

Well, we had quite the eventful end to the week, which brings me to some exciting news for HigherDose..

I'm thrilled to share that we’ve eliminated the evaluation process & we can now partner with any brand on a CPA rate. No more asking for metrics or meeting pre-qualification steps!

After 3.5 years of building CTV on a performance model, our founders and leadership team are all-in. They're extremely confident in our product, media team, and inventory partnerships - and now we’re ready to partner with all brands on a CPA or CPL model.

In addition to sharing this news, please find a quick (updated) overview of our opportunity below, along with our recommendations for this new approach & onboarding next steps.

If you're ready to move forward with onboarding to test with tvScientific, please share your CPA rate details!

Cheers!

Hi Anastasia & Karalyn,

Hope you both are surviving BFCM prep! 🙃

Checking in one more time to see if you were interested in testing HigherDose on streaming TV on a cost per sale (CPA)?

We've made a handful of advancements since we last connected. Please let me know if you would like to reconnect!

Cheers,
Morgan

HI Anastasia & Karalyn,

Hope you both are doing well!

With the holidays almost here, I would love to revisit a potential CTV partnership with Higher Dose. With online traffic increasing, we could offer you a lower CPA rate, if you're interested in testing with us soon?

We are seeing a great performance from our health/wellness brands that have similar audiences to Higher Dose: Bioma, Colonbroom, Dermstore, Prose & many more!

Always happy to hop on a call to reconnect! For ease, you're welcome to find a time that works best for you here: Morgan's Calendar<https://calendly.com/mbellschildt/tvscientific>.

Hi Anastasia & Karalyn!

I can not believe how fast Summer has flown by! 🙃

We are quickly gearing up for Q4 holiday time, so I wanted to check in to see if HigherDose would be interested in running a test with tvScientific? It would be great to get a test underway & apply learnings to hit the gas for gifting time!

Hi Anastasia & Karalyn,

Sincerely appreciate your patience!

When we explore a partnership, we first run an evaluation to determine if we can take on the risk of buying the CPM media for the brand & offer a CPA partnership. We usually need +350k monthly uniques to take on this risk. However, we've recently decided to take on the risk for select brands that don't meet the traffic requirement. I spoke to my director this morning & we're willing to take on this risk for HigherDose 😊

The compromise would be allowing tvScientific to earn a higher CPA. This higher CPA allows us to earn enough commission to re-invest into the media spend so we can test more with furthering audience reach. Our hope is that we would reduce the CPA rate as we uncover converting audiences & gain efficiency in the media buy.

Launch Recommendation: 25% on all purchases with 7 day attribution window

Please let me know if you would like to hop on a call this week to discuss our recommendation further! For ease, you're welcome to always book time with me here: Morgan's Calendar<https://calendly.com/mbellschildt/tvscientific>

Lastly, I've attached two resources for your reference: tvSci CPA overview & our update media inventory list.
Cheers!
Morgan

Hi Anastasia,

Hope you're having a lovely week!

Reaching out to make sure you know I haven't forgotten about you 😉 Our Senior Leadership asked me to hold on our affiliate evaluations this week. Sounds like we've got a few exciting things cooking that might impact how we approach affiliate partnerships. I was told I would be given more details in the next few days.

I did have a quick question - How quickly do you typically see consumers purchase after visiting the site for the first time? We know sometimes a higher purchase value can cause consumers needing a few days to "think about it." Asking because this would impact our attribution window recommendation.

Cheers!
Morgan

Hi Anastasia,

So great to hear from you! And apologies for not following up yet - I've had my parents visiting the last week & I decided to take some time off 😉

Providing information & resources on tvScientfic<https://www.tvscientific.com/> below, along with a refresher on how it works & the metrics I'll need to run the CPA Partnership Evaluation.

tvScientific Resources:
· Morgan's Affiliate Summit West Presentation - CTV on a CPA Overview<[www.loom.com](https://www.loom.com/share/fa966196812a49c39c868726a25618ca?sid=faefba57-0625-4178-88d0-b1c7469c69f0>)
· CTV on a CPA Overview deck<[docs.google.com](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NmOA4clTyT0MDU7MqyMqf0h7-o7be9uk/edit?usp=sharing&amp;amp;ouid=115995092613158324938&amp;amp;rtpof=true&amp;amp;sd=true>) (case studies & FAQs included in this deck)
· tvScientific one-sheeter (attached)
· Pixel tech integration guides (attached)

How it Works (high-level):

* When we show an ad, we record the home's IP address. That results in an exposure file of everyone who saw your ad & their OTT devices.
* We then do a 1x1 deterministic match back to the conversion data you're sharing with us via pixel.

* In order for the attribution to track properly, your brand will need to set up a pixel or postback on your website or tag manager to pass back all event/conversion data to tvScientific (all channels, not just affiliate).

* We earn commission if we are anywhere in the conversion path within 7 days.
* After launching, we let the data guide us towards the optimal CPA rate & attribution that will ensure we are complimentary to your overall marketing strategy.

CPA Partnership Evaluation:

* Metrics (US and/or CA only):
· Average monthly unique visits
· Average monthly conversion rate (for all channels combined)
· Average monthly volume of purchases
· Average monthly order value
· What is your standard affiliate offer (payable event & commission rate?)

Always happy to hop on a call to reconnect & discuss live! For ease, you're welcome to find a time that works best for you here: Morgan's Calendar<https://calendly.com/mbellschildt/tvscientific>.
