2. *Exposure Optimization Strategy*

*Red Light Hat*
We’re seeing *significant traffic going to the Red Hat* , but the *conversion rate continue to drop to extremely low rate*. This has been consistent week after week and is starting to affect overall performance—both in terms of wasted media spend and the impact it has on visibility and sales of other products.

This could mean a few things:

*

People are interested but dropping off due to price (especially in a competitive environment),

*

Or there are active campaigns driving traffic to this product without resulting in sales.

*See comparison WoW*
