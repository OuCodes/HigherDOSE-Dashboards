We think you'll love it. It can help you control costs and could even boost customer loyalty! | | **Instead of paying return shipping and restocking fees****,****you can offer a partial refund on the order—allowing the customer to keep the item at a discounted price.** | | **How does the Partial Refund feature work?** | | That's up to you! The Partial Refund feature is customizable, so you get to decide when it's offered to a customer by setting rules\* — giving you more control over your shop's customer experience after a sale. | | *\*Returnless refunds take priority over partial refunds. This means that if a product is eligible for a returnless refund, then you can no longer offer a partial refund.* | | **How do the rules work?** | | The Partial Refund feature allows you to set up automatic rules for partial refunds in the **Seller Center** using the **Preference** **settings****.**  When a customer requests a partial refund that fits the criteria you've set, they'll automatically get the refund without requiring a return. | | Instead of incurring return costs for shipping and restocking, you can retain part of the sale and the customer gets to keep the item at a reduced price. | | * Product Category * Item Price * Return Reason * Refund Range | | **Make sure to review your rules regularly** | | You are responsible for the rules you set for automatic Partial Refund. Appeals will not be accepted for automatic partial refunds that result from seller error in rule creation or modification. So make sure to double-check your rule preferences and keep them updated as your shop grows. | | For more information about eligibility and appeals, check out our [Partial Refunds feature guide.](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ8WFR7BtXHX) To learn more about customizing your after-sales experience, please refer to our [Customizing Your Return and Refund Features guide.](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ8WFR7CAaJA) | | Be sure to regularly check [TikTok Shop Academy](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ8WFR7CRdLh) to stay informed and follow the [@TikTokShopAcademy](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ8WFR7CigNE) channel for tips and tricks on staying up to date. | | Happy selling, | | TikTok Shop | | |
