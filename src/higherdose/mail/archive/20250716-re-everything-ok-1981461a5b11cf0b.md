## Body

Hey Ingrid,

Yes ma'am thank you for asking and I'm back online. We're getting her to
the Ortho this afternoon. I'll have the complete executive summary
<[docs.google.com](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aUkKJ_d8kcrFlGYfT7RB0QhgDug2_WDteBpj9kcKw1A/edit?usp=sharing>)
over to you soon and have everything I need to be successful in this role.

I'm working on an automation that will help me compile the data and updates
a lot faster just running into errors with formatting this much data in a
Google Doc.

It's all based on North Beam data and I was able to break out performance
by product based on keywords in campaign, ad set, and ad names but there's
some ads with missing data which I included a table of further down.

My sincere apologies for missing the Sharma call yesterday and will
communicate proactively if  I'm not able to make meetings in the future so
we can adjust if necessary.
