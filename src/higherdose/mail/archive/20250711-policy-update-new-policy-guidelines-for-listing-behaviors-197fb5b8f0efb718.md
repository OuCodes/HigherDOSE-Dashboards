| |  | | --- | | Hi Seller! | | We have updated our Product Listing Policy to include a new product listing behavior that is prohibited. This addition is meant to protect the customer experience and help your shop continue to build customer trust. | | **Misleading product listings:***Sellers are strictly prohibited from repurposing existing product listings**to represent a different product**, also known as "bait and switch"**.**This includes using an existing listing but changing key details such as the title, images, brand, or price in a way that misleads customers and invalidates previous reviews or**delivery* *data**.* | | **Best Practices for Product Listings** | | * Ensure all listing content, including titles, images, and descriptions, accurately reflects the product’s appearance, functionality, and effect. * Create a new listing when introducing a different version of a product, such as a redesign or updated model, so that reviews, ratings, and order data reflect the correct item. * Make only minor changes, such as updating images, price, description, or SKU, if the product itself remains the same. These changes should still reflect the exact product being sold. * Avoid making major edits that change the product being sold, such as switching the image, title, brand, or price in a way that misrepresents the original product. | | The violation of this new policy can result in enforcement actions being taken. For more information, refer to our **[Product Listing Policy.](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ8JZNozXXQE)** | | To learn more about best practices, please refer to our **[Product Listing: What You Need to Know](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ8JZNozoaSl)**article. | | Be sure to regularly check **[TikTok Shop Academy](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ8JZNp05dUX)** to stay informed and follow the **[@TikTokShopAcademy](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ8JZNp0MgWZ)** channel for tips and tricks on staying up to date. | |
