Actions taken and points for next week

-

Our lower AOV product funnel went live today. We are starting with a
traffic campaign to build an audience over the next 3-5 days. We can use
this to learn the best audiences to target for the bottom of the funnel as
well as build a true long term retargeting list.
-

The body sculptor presale creatives are live in a traffic campaign as
well. The plan is to move these to conversion in July, however since we are
trying to drive awareness of a higher end product not fully available we
are starting with traffic.


As always, please let us know if you have any questions at all! We're
working to get more MBS creative live before the weekend as well. Excited
to report on this next week!

Thank you and have a great weekend!
Abigale + SB Team
