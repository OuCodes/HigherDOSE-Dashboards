Hey Chris,

We're currently working with our Google reps on an exercise to calculate
the breakeven ROAS and CPA targets by product/category, so we can apply
more tailored goals to those specific campaigns, on Google.

We've put together a sheet with all the inputs needed for the
calculation [linked
here]
<[docs.google.com](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OWK3ARhw6UBPBb8mCwPmfXX_vAcWHPtQ5ExbUMlGUW8/edit?gid=0#gid=0>,)
and would love for you to take a quick look to make sure everything looks
accurate so the calculations will be spot on.

Let us know if any info on this sheet seems way off and needs to be
changed.

Best,
Rahul.
