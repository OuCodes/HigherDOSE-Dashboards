| |  | | --- | | Whether you're crushing sales in Deals For You Days or taking a break in Holiday Mode, we're here to provide you with a handy-dandy overview of our policy updates via our Policy Pulse newsletter—so you don't miss a beat! | | **What's New?** | | **Want to become authorized to sell licensed or co-branded products? We've got a new pathway for that!  🤝** | | You can now submit brand authorization applications using: | | * Licensee Agreements * Co-Branding Documentation | | For more information, refer to our **[Guide to Obtaining Brand Authorization](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ8OxQSUqWaz)** and **[Intellectual Property Policy](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ8OxQSV7Zcz)**. | | **Need a directory to find compliance documentation providers? Say less! 📚** | | The new **Service Providers Network** is now available in Seller Center. This directory features vendors specializing in compliance, documentation, and regulatory support. | | * In the Product Compliance section of the **[Qualification Center](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ8OxQSVOce1)**, you’ll see a banner: **"Connect with service providers for compliance support now."** * Click **Explore Providers** to visit the Service Providers page and find the support you need. | | **Violations happen! We'll help guide you through the appeal process. 😇** | | We've added resources to Academy that cover what you need to do when appealing specific violations. We have started with the most frequent violations, and will add more over time! Check out our **[Intellectual Property Appeal Guide](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ8OxQSVffgY)**and **[Identity Verification Appeal Guide](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ8OxQSVwii5)**. | | **New phone, who dis? 🔗📲** | | For account protection, you are **required to have a phone number linked to your account and two-step verification set up**with your shop. | | For more information, refer to our **[Securing your Account with Two-Step Verification](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ8OxQSWDlki)**article. | | **Less hassle and more flexibility! 📦** | | **Return labels and QR codes are now valid for up to 30 days.** | | Customers can use them at any time within the standard 30-day return window or within the approved timeframe for customized return cases. | | **Keep keepin' it real. Building customer trust through accurate product listings is key to growing your shop.**🏆 | | We’ve  **added new prohibited listing behaviors to the** **[Product Listing Policy](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ8OxQSWUomF)** that address misleading claims about a product’s functionality or effects. This includes false, exaggerated, or unproven claims—such as misleading “before and after” images, unverified performance claims, or statements that lack appropriate evidence or violate local advertising laws. | | **What's new with the Restricted Product Policy? So glad you asked! 🤓** | | We’ve revamped the **[Restricted Products Policy](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ8OxQSWlrom)** with a clearer structure that outlines which products require: | | * Category-level qualification * Product-level qualification * Invite-only qualification | | Review the latest version of the policy to determine if any restricted products you’d like to sell are eligible for qualification—and refer to the corresponding policy to begin your application. | |
