Some people who engage with businesses on Messenger will see a new screen explaining how information from that chat, such as messages and actions, might be used by Meta to improve their experience. This may include improving response times, ads and features like translations and AI. However, this doesn't change our long-standing policy that we do not sell people's information and never will. | |  |  |  | | --- | | People can access information about their business chat privacy and data use any time by tapping on the business' name at the top of a chat and selecting **Privacy information**. | |  |  |  | | --- | | The information described in the new disclosure is different from [business activities]([www.facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1176420112997278),) such as lead status and labels, which businesses can choose to share with Meta through Meta Business Suite or other business tools. | |  | | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | --- | | Read more about how chats between businesses and people work on Messenger. | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | [|  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | |  | | | |  | [Help Center]([www.facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/5027636907313972)) |  | |  | | |]([www.facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/5027636907313972)) | |  | | |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | --- | | For further questions, contact customer support or visit our Support Center. | |  | | |  | |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | --- | | **Thank you,** | |  | | |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | --- | | **The Meta Team** | |  | | |  | | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | --- | | This email was sent to jourdan@higherdose.com.
