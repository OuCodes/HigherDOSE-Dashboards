Enabling two-step authentication is a valuable step in
securing your account.

To ensure uninterrupted access, download your recovery
codes.
These codes allow you to log in if you lose access to your
authentication methods.
Keep them in a secure place and treat them like passwords.

security settings immediately to protect your account.
