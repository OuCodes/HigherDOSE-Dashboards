## Body

Hey George,

Not sure how much value my response will be since I wasn't on the
previous call.

I assume we can't cover all 3 on one call but hitting the first 2 if
possible would be awesome.

Reviewing sequential purchase behavior - Will help us allocate the right
resources behind products that allow the business to grow.
Strategies for Retention during the summer - Summer has been a tough period
historically and bolstering retention channels can help with revenue
growth.
Review New Product Launch - Body Sculpt was a successful launch and I
selfishly want all the details.


Thank you,
