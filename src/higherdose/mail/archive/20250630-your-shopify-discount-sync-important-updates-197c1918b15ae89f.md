| |  |  | | --- | --- | | |  | | --- | | Hi Seller,  **We've upgraded how your Shopify discounts sync to TikTok Shop** , so you can now optimize this feature for better results. As **"Deals For You Days"** approaches, review the changes and update your setup to capitalize on this big shopping event.  Key Things to Know Your Shopify discounts automatically appear in TikTok Shop, but they work a bit differently: * **Discount codes become automatic** - those with no usage limit and no targeting will be auto applied. Customers don't need to enter codes. * **Only "all customers" discounts sync** - we do not sync any that have specific targeting set in Shopify. * **Usage limit syncing is updated** - see our [easy view guide](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ80jwbxD3SK) for specific details on which purchase requirements and discount usages sync based on promotion type. * **Discount combination syncing has changed** - see our [easy view guide](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ80jwbxD3SK) for specific details. Not all discount types work - some sync perfectly, others need adjustments to sync. What You Need to Do  1. **Read our** **[detailed feature guide](https://m.tiktok.shop/s/AJ80jwbxl9WO)** to understand how discount sync works and how to optimize 2. **Go to your** **[TikTok for Shopify app]([accounts.shopify.com](https://accounts.shopify.com/lookup?rid=bea846e6-4499-44b5-b61f-ce4252f758e0&verify=1741209111-XRh3BKbhruERSltpaCJPJ6Id3Y6o6QwD3x5j2JOj4Nk%3D)**) **> Marketing > Promotion Sync** to:  1.
