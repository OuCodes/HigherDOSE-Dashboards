Hey Tori / Ingrid,

*Thursday at 1:30 PM ET / 10:30 AM PT* is the latest slot we have available
from the Sharma end, on the day. Let us know if this slot works for you
guys @Tori Kimball <torikimball@google.com> @Ingrid Milman Cordy
<ingrid@higherdose.com> .

Unfortunately, we don't have any other slots on Thursday or Friday, so we
might need to reschedule if you guys can't make the above slot. Let us
know, we'll be happy to share some slots for next week!

Finally, @Tori Kimball <torikimball@google.com> @Billy McLellan
<billymclellan@google.com>  as discussed, we've compiled some creative for
you guys to audit:

Here's what's already live under Demand Gen and performing well:
