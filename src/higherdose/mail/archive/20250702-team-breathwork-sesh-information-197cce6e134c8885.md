## Body

Hello team,

Hope everyone is experiencing a nourishing day so far!

A little deep dive of what’s happening when I guide my breathwork sessions paired with specific music to help give the best all round experience ✨

The science & spirit of my 3 part breathwork method

Part 1: Inhale through the nose (4 sec), exhale through the mouth with a vibrational sigh (8 sec)

Science: This activates the parasympathetic nervous system, the part of us responsible for calm, rest, and digestion.

Body: The longer exhale lowers cortisol, relaxes your heart rate, and tells your body “you’re safe.”

Mind: It gently eases the brainwaves from a beta (alert) state into alpha (relaxed, meditative).

Soul: You’re grounding. Arriving. Reclaiming presence. This is the opening of the portal.

——————

Part 2: Double inhale through the mouth (expanding through the diaphragm, then expanding through the chest) → exhaling through mouth with a vibrational sigh

Science: This pattern floods the body with oxygen and lightly expels CO₂. The diaphragmatic + thoracic combo brings breath deeper into unused lung capacity.

Body: Oxygenating the blood and stimulating the vagus nerve for emotional release and cellular activation.

Mind: Begins to clear mental fog and awaken dormant clarity and emotion.

Soul: This opens the heart center. Stored emotions can now move and be felt.

——————

Part 3: Continuous, circular mouth breathing (no pauses at the top or bottom of the breath)

Science: This induces a mild respiratory alkalosis, a shift in blood pH that creates a dreamlike state, enhancing access to the subconscious and stored trauma.

Body: You’ll feel tingling, warmth, or lightness as your nervous system adjusts and releases.

Mind: A meditative, altered state. The Default Mode Network (the brain’s ego center) slows & calms down for the need to control various outcomes

Soul: This is your gateway to deeper truths, energetic clearing, and direct downloads from the higher self.

——————

Final 30 Seconds: Double time breath + full-body squeeze + hold then release the breath and body at the same time to drop into a deep meditative state

Science: Rapid breathing followed by a hold causes a neurochemical cocktail… dopamine, serotonin, and natural DMT like molecules surge. The muscle squeeze activates a full-body reset through neural tension release.

Body: The squeeze engages the pelvic floor and core, amplifying life force energy (kundalini), resetting the autonomic nervous system.

Mind: Your perception of time starts to slow down… Inner stillness expands. You’ve entered the theta state, the brainwave of healing and transformation.

Soul: This moment is where many people feel oneness, clarity, peace, and breakthroughs.

Looking forward to meeting & connecting with everyone tomorrow 🙏🏼🌬️✨🕊️
