Hi Chris,

Makes a ton of sense. We'll be connecting w/ our Google reps this week and
we can certainly add you to that call to discuss this in detail. I'm still
waiting to finalize a date and time for our chat. Will make sure to check
in on your availability too, before finalizing things.

Best,
Rahul.
