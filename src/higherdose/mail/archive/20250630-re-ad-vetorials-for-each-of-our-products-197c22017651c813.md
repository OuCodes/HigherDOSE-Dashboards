## Body

Hey Elyse,

Here's a few examples I've sent Ingrid regarding advertorials.

This one is inline with the shoppale page and blog post
[agelesslx.com](https://agelesslx.com/pages/bye-bye-soft-body-wrinkled-sagging-skin/)

Here are X reasons why advertorial examples. Often referred to as
listicle style advertorials.

[theearthlingco.com](https://theearthlingco.com/pages/5-reasons-why-shampoo-bar-conditioner-bar-free-soap-dish)

Here's the traditional style advertorial that educates before sending them
to a shoppable experience

Here's an article from GemPages breaking down different advertorial
approaches to give more ideas around potential layout.

I'm aligned with Ingrid on creating a shoppable + blog post style page.
That is a newer trend so a little harder to find working examples

Thank you,
Jourdan Smith
