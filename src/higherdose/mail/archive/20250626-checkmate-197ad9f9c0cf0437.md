HI Jourdan,

We haven't properly met yet - I'm Anastasia, I manage Affiliates and
Creator partnerships.
Ingrid said to connect with you about this opportunity. It's an
affiliate partnership, but it does work as an app plug-in with Shopify.

They are eager to work with us and have offered the below add-ons as well
as dropped the monthly fee, and there is no contract attached.  Adding
their deck below for more information as well.

Let me know your thoughts and if you want me to connect us all on a call
with Checkmate.

"We can offer the following additional HigherDose placements to our 2M+
users and 1.5M+ social followers:

- In-app merchant page customization
- Homepage carousel featured tile
- 1x Push Notification + in app notification dedicated
- 2x IG story social feature with link to shop

For the promotion, we can either mirror your welcome offer at 10%, or your
July 4th promo amount.

Set up takes 5-10 minutes and there are no monthly contracts, fees, or
upfront commitments."


Best,
Anastasia
