## Body

Thank you for the summary!

HD team, just fyi since we just made all the major structural changes in
Meta, this softer week is expected. We intentionally did it during Prime
“Day” (week) since we knew results would be mixed this week regardless.

We are checking in on performance daily and also uncovering a ton more
information about our product demand in this new structure so it’s a win
for that alone - then the sales will follow the optimization.

Thanks and have a great weekend.

Imc
