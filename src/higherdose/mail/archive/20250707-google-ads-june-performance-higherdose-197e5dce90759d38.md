Hi Ingrid,

Hope you had a fantastic long weekend!

Since we are 7 days past the end of June, I wanted to send over a quick
Google Ads performance recap for the month:

June Performance Snapshot:

-

Conversion Value: $803,148.61
-

Cost: $123,362.33
-

ROAS: 6.51
-

ROAS by time: 6.98

Overall, June's performance looked great! We'll keep a close eye on
campaign-level performance as they adjust to their updated budgets this
month. Additionally, our upper-funnel YouTube campaigns will play a key
role in our success and expanding reach ahead of Q4.
Cheers,
