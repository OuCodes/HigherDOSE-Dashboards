| Overall DTC spend increased 6.2% WoW while CAC improved by 2.2%, driving
a modest 2.7% lift in ROAS, with Google and Awin leading growth (Google
spend +11.7%, Awin spend +35.7%) and CAC efficiencies. Major wins include a
17% boost in Shopify sales, AWIN’s 35% spend growth with a 12% lower CAC,
and onboarding Prescient AI for improved measurement. Top areas to watch
are rising Meta CAC amid pulled-back budgets, underperforming TikTok and
AppLovin channels, and the need to optimize creative mix on Red Light
campaigns.
when reporting % changes, please share the period (MoM? YoY? L7?)
