Hi Ingrid and Jourdan,


This is Robin from the Elevar support team — great to connect with you both!


Elevar serves as the infrastructure that powers your Shopify store’s connection to marketing platforms, following industry best practices for server-side tracking and data accuracy.


Your Elevar account is currently connected to the following marketing destinations using our server-side setup: GA4, Meta, TikTok, Pinterest, Google Ads, Microsoft Ads, Klaviyo, and Postscript.


We're able to set up custom events, including passing New Customer data — and I can see that this is already configured for Facebook, TikTok and Google Ads.


The best next step would be to schedule a platform training session with our Customer Success team. I’ve looped them in on this thread, and someone will follow up shortly to coordinate a time.


I was able to confirm that invites have already been sent to both of you for access to the Elevar account.


Please feel free to reach out with any questions or if there’s anything else we can help with!


Kind Regards,

Robin

Thanks Chris and thanks for hoping right in, Jourdan!

Elevar team, I'm also in need of understanding when to use Elevar vs. GA4, etc. I'm an old marketing dog and love GA but our GA4 instance is not properly integrated (for example, our item name levels are not pulling through). Would love a chat.

Best,
Ingrid

Hey Chris, thanks for connecting us!

I'm familiar with Elevar and have used similar tools previously. Congrats on the brand/name change!

Are you guys able to pass back New Customer data into the ad account?

I'm not sure if a call is necessary but I'd love to know key differences between Elevar and tools like Converge or Blotout.

Also I don't think I have access to an account with Elevar so that would be helpful too!

Thank you,

Elevar team, connecting you with Ingrid and Jourdan that have come on to run marketing since we first onboarded

I think it's best if we set a group call for them to understand Elevar as I had limited understanding and it was guided by a prior agency

Hi Chris,


I can confirm that the Elevar integration for Awin has been paused.

I’d recommend reaching out to the Awin support team now to ensure the data looks as expected on their end.


Feel free to reach out to us if you’d like to migrate back to Elevar for Awin, or if you need assistance with any other marketing destination.

Hi Chris,


Yes, that makes sense. I understand that they’re referring to GTM web and server-side containers, which aren’t currently being used.

With Elevar, we host the server-side data, so a GTM server container isn’t needed—everything is managed within our app.


Would you like me to pause the Awin server-side tracking for now? Since it’s already enabled within the Shopify app, I wouldn't want to cause more duplicate tracking.


Let me know how you’d like me to proceed!

See below from Awin does this make sense toyou?

You should have two GTM containers if S2S is present in GTM. Container types: web and server. The server container should have the S2S implementation.
Here is how the server container should look -
[Image_2025-03-24_10-13-56.png]

If you are using Elevar for the Server tracking, it will not show in GTM. You will need to remove it directly from the Elevar application. We do not have any guides on how to remove it, you will need to check directly on Elever how to pause/remove it.

Hi Chris,


No problem! The Elevar setup will be fully active again by simply re-enabling those two tags in GTM (Awin - AW Last Click Identifier and Awin - Journey).


That said, I’d recommend discussing on your end why the Awin app tracking was re-enabled.


In the meantime, I suggest pausing our integration to prevent duplicate data from being sent.


If you decide to switch back to the Elevar integration for Awin at any point, I’d be happy to coordinate a time to re-enable it on our end after confirming that the Awin app tracking is disabled.


Let me know if that works for you, and I’ll proceed with pausing our integration for now.

Thank you so much for quick reply here.  This is all beyond me but so I can go back to them (if this is the right question for me to ask?)

Which of the tags does Elevar need to have running to function?  And which is it ok to pause?

Hi Chris,


This is Robin from the Elevar support team—I hope you’re doing well.


I can confirm what the media agency already noted. It looks like some tags needed for our server-side integration were paused in GTM about 22 days ago. This suggests that tracking may have been re-enabled within the AWIN app on that date.

[cid:ii_19819b74cf51baeeeb3b]

However, pausing the GTM tags doesn’t completely disable the setup implemented through the Elevar integration, which remains active here<[app.getelevar.com](https://app.getelevar.com/company/43981/website/47868/my-tracking/destination-awin/196>.)


Let me know if you’d like me to fully pause our server-side setup as well, or if you’d prefer to revert to our integration. In that case, you’d need to disable AWIN tracking within the app to prevent duplicates.


Let me know how you’d like to proceed.

Our media agency noted the below does this make sense?

But by looking at that first screenshot you shared which appears to show a shopify app connection as well as your elevar connection, my best guess now is that you're having issues with inaccurate/duplicated transactions/data. I've had a look in your shopify account directly and saw that the Awin app has been re-installed on 26th Feb (and I also saw that the two Awin tags in GTM were paused on this date too). I assume Awin advised you to reinstall the Awin Shopify App app and pause GTM tags to try and fix the original "issues"? The problem with your setup since those changes were made on Feb 26 is that you still have the Elevar server side data pushing directly to Awin. So your current setup is:

* You have server side purchase events being sent directly from Elevar
* You have the Awin app also directly installed on your shopify site, which is also sending events directly to Awin

Elevar team we have a critical issue with Google Tag Manager relating to Awin install (affiliates) - there is an additional container no one can find

I know little about GTM and have checked with everyone on our side.  Reaching out as perhaps Elevar has general expertise they could bring to bear here? (I appreciate it in advance)

Awin provided the below but none of this obviously shows ____ tag involved

We only have these tags in our container that we have access to

1.  Once access is provided, I’ll pull the order data so we can begin the personas buildout.

1.  I’ll coordinate with Hannah to set up your MFT credentials and ensure they’re communicated with you promptly.

If you haven't already, please follow the Klaviyo instructions under “Add Users” in this article<[help.klaviyo.com](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360053547071>) and add the following users with the Manager or Admin role:

Hey Chris,



Excited to introduce you to Jeff Davis and David Shuford from your Elevar/Buxton Customer Success team. We can’t wait to get started on developing HigherDOSE’s Customer Personas.



For next steps:

1.  Can you review this doc<[elevar.notion.site](https://elevar.notion.site/Buxton-Personas-Access-Requirements-17e1b4c011c3476bb77253f5973ffca4>) to ensure we have proper access to your Shopify and Klaviyo? This is needed for us to pull historical data and for the Persona appends.

* David will verify this, so please send any questions his way.

1.  Once we have access to your systems, we will confirm when all data is successfully downloaded.
2.  Shortly, you will receive an email from Buxton’s IT (ITDept@buxtonco.com<mailto:ITDept@buxtonco.com>) with subject line “Buxton MFT Credentials.” Please follow these instructions to set up your access to the managed file transfer site. This will allow you to easily pick up initial and ongoing deliverables and keep them in one place.
3.  Your initial analysis will be complete in ~30 days from our access to the data set. Jeff will be in touch as this date approaches to set up a time to review together.

I’m always available to you as a resource -- let me know if you ever need anything!



All the best,

Shane
