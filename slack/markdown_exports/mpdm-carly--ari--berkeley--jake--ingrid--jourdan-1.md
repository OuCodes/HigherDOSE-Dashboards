- **2025-06-16 15:40** *Ingrid*: Starting a new smaller group slack with Jourdan
- **2025-06-16 15:40** *Ingrid*: ok - can we do $1.6 (total) in July on $350k spend?
- **2025-06-16 15:41** *Ingrid*: without a July4, but with the option to pulse a flash late month if needed
- **2025-06-16 16:45** *Berkeley Clark (@berkeley)*: We think the goal is strong but within reach!
- **2025-06-16 19:52** *Ingrid*: Ok cool- I’ll share the details with you guys in person - it all seems very within reach 
- **2025-06-23 11:25** *Jourdan*: Morning team! Was today’s sync meeting canceled or moved? I’m not seeing an invite for today
- **2025-06-23 11:35** *Ari Murray (@ari)*: hi yes so sorry! we've now added you recurrently - see you soon
- **2025-06-23 11:35** *Jourdan*: Thank you!
- **2025-06-23 15:02** *Ingrid*: 
- **2025-06-23 15:02** *Ari Murray (@ari)*: 
- **2025-06-24 13:02** *Ingrid*: i feel like it's safe to remove the pre-sale from the MBS ads if you haven't already?
- **2025-06-24 13:09** *Berkeley Clark (@berkeley)*: Will double check on this and remove if we still have!
- **2025-06-25 11:09** *Ingrid*: <@U014QPT7LCE> do you have time today to go through selects with me from the photo shoot?
- **2025-06-25 11:09** *Ingrid*: (anyone else is invited too but def need Carly(
- **2025-06-25 11:10** *Ingrid*: Lauren is doing a pickup lifestyle shoot on Sunday at her home upstate so would be good to align on what we need from that ahead of it
- **2025-06-25 11:23** *Ari Murray (@ari)*: hii! carly is out for her wedding :heart:
- **2025-06-25 11:23** *Ari Murray (@ari)*: but happy to bring christina and abigale into the fold - they have the eye!
- **2025-06-25 16:06** *Ingrid*: yes! are they free tomorrow at at 8am PDT/11am EDT?
- **2025-06-25 16:18** *Ari Murray (@ari)*: yesssss! abigale will send the invite out now 
- **2025-06-26 14:41** *Ingrid*: hey guys sales are crazy low today (even for a slow June Thursday)
- **2025-06-26 14:42** *Ingrid*: anything we should be concerned about on paid side?
- **2025-06-26 14:54** *Berkeley Clark (@berkeley)*: Not seeing anything abnormal efficiency wise on any of our channels today. We did have a hard day on Meta yesterday, but are diving in here and investigating further.
- **2025-06-26 14:57** *Berkeley Clark (@berkeley)*: Sessions aren't down dramatically DoD, despite rev being down 88% -- it looks like it is both a CVR and AOV flag!
- **2025-06-26 15:07** *Berkeley Clark (@berkeley)*: We did take a look at days on average and it does look like Thursday's are generally a bit lower. This on top of the macro consumer behavior (holding buying/building carts) we are seeing ahead of July 4 in anticipation of sales could explain the dip, but do want to get a little further and past the end of the work day before calling anything.
- **2025-06-26 15:15** *Ingrid*: ok thanks for looking into it, makes sense
- **2025-06-26 15:15** *Berkeley Clark (@berkeley)*: one last note!
- **2025-06-26 15:15** *Ingrid*: and yea let's def figure out meta
- **2025-06-26 15:16** *Ingrid*: <@U0913R7KB7E> anything on your end?
- **2025-06-26 15:16** *Berkeley Clark (@berkeley)*: Actually looks like there was a big return or two today compared to on average, already around ~10k in returns compared to a $5k total day yesterday
- **2025-06-26 15:16** *Ingrid*: ah ok
- **2025-06-26 15:16** *Ingrid*: thats helpful
- **2025-06-26 15:17** *Ingrid*: unrelated question - do we get any value from using this <https://higherdose.com/collections/infrared-sauna-collection?ic=nav_click> 🡪  (the ic=nav_click) portion for tracking?
- **2025-06-26 15:17** *Ingrid*: it got flagged for now SEO best practice so was wondering if i can remove
- **2025-06-26 15:26** *Berkeley Clark (@berkeley)*: This is a pretty granular utm which looks like its saying that the traffic campaign internally from a click in the nav. We should be okay to remove that for SEO best practices and can pull that same data from shopify/heat maps!
- **2025-06-26 15:33** *Ingrid*: ok thanks!
- **2025-06-30 11:49** *Berkeley Clark (@berkeley)*: Pinterest not being able to segment to solely click data is so telling about the platform I feel
- **2025-06-30 11:49** *Berkeley Clark (@berkeley)*: But we will dive into GA4 today and can follow up / discuss later on our sync next best steps
- **2025-06-30 11:50** *Ingrid*: ok thanks for that - weird indeed
- **2025-06-30 11:50** *Ingrid*: <@U0913R7KB7E> what were your thoughts after connecting with Daniel?
- **2025-06-30 13:04** *Jourdan*: Yes very telling. GA4 should give us more insight into what’s possible from the channel. If we saw better performance from conversion campaigns then it’ll be worth testing there but I’m seeing the same trends I’ve seen with other brands on this channel.
- **2025-06-30 13:04** *Jourdan*: I think MMM will tell us the ultimate truth on its effectiveness
- **2025-06-30 14:06** *Ingrid*: we have approval to go forward with prescient
- **2025-06-30 14:06** *(unknown:U05KD2RULPN)*: Amazing!!!
- **2025-06-30 14:07** *Ari Murray (@ari)*: HELL YESSSS
- **2025-06-30 14:07** *Ari Murray (@ari)*: lmk if we should give mike the good news!
- **2025-06-30 14:07** *Ari Murray (@ari)*: tysm for this 
- **2025-06-30 14:29** *Ingrid*: I'll officially let him know, all good
- **2025-06-30 14:29** *Ari Murray (@ari)*: yayy thank you!!
- **2025-07-02 14:24** *Jourdan*: Hey <@U04PHVC4WJH> does SB have work with any brands in the disruptor program at Meta?
- **2025-07-02 14:26** *Ari Murray (@ari)*: hi <@U0913R7KB7E> jumping in
- **2025-07-02 14:27** *Ari Murray (@ari)*: none of our current clients are in the program but a former multi-year client of ours is in there. we have contacts within and spend is insanely high as a bar from what we understand currently
- **2025-07-02 14:27** *Ari Murray (@ari)*: they spend 70M a year
- **2025-07-02 14:28** *Ari Murray (@ari)*: lmk if there's anything we can provide here / any more detail on what we know!
- **2025-07-02 14:29** *Jourdan*: Yeah i’ve been in a couple brands that were part of the program. Would love to know min spend requirements and how long we need to maintain, the type of brands they’re looking for in the program, and anything else that would help put us on their radar
- **2025-07-02 14:29** *Ari Murray (@ari)*: we can try to ask!
- **2025-07-02 14:29** *Jourdan*: Okay thank you!
- **2025-07-02 14:29** *Ari Murray (@ari)*: we'll reach out today and as soon as we hear we'll revert back
- **2025-07-02 14:29** *Ari Murray (@ari)*: would be my dream
- **2025-07-02 14:30** *Jourdan*: yes its such a fun program! Beta access to new products and the marketing summit invites
- **2025-07-02 14:31** *Jourdan*: also a women owned brand could give us a bit more leverage over others
- **2025-07-02 14:31** *Ari Murray (@ari)*: loveee that
- **2025-07-02 14:32** *Jourdan*: The google reps we just spoke with gave me disruptor vibes so had to ask lol
- **2025-07-09 11:51** *Jourdan*: Yo <@U05KD2RULPN> just following up on Single Product Campaigns and pausing out the Legacy Camps. Are we still on track for EOD?
- **2025-07-09 12:00** *(unknown:U05KD2RULPN)*: Hey <@U0913R7KB7E>! Yes still tracking for EOD- I'll be sure to ping when we're all set. Just for your view here’s the setup we’re going with:  
Red Light Hat  
Red Light Mask  
PEMF Go Mat  
Sauna Blanket  
Bundles
- **2025-07-09 12:00** *(unknown:U05KD2RULPN)*: legacy ASCs/DABAs will be paused shortly as well!
- **2025-07-09 12:01** *Jourdan*: Sweet thank you for the update sir
- **2025-07-09 12:02** *(unknown:U05KD2RULPN)*: No problem! Also confirming we'll be using the CBO style setup for these campaigns
- **2025-07-09 12:02** *Jourdan*: Oooo juicy juicy
- **2025-07-09 13:23** *Ingrid*: no idea what that is but the emoji usage is top notch
- **2025-07-09 14:22** *(unknown:U05KD2RULPN)*: Big day!!! Confirmed the new setup is done <@U0913R7KB7E> <@U0824M6DHLK>! Dropping a few logistical notes below for your eyes
- **2025-07-09 14:25** *(unknown:U05KD2RULPN)*: • Along with legacy ASC/DABA campaigns, we have also turned off the retention campaign. It was on the wrong attribution window and it’s one of the lower performing campaigns L30 and beyond, we can refresh this with new customer lists in the near future but for now while we have a ton in learning best to have this inactive  
• Current Setup:  
    ◦ Red Light Mask CBO  
    ◦ Red Light Hat CBO  
    ◦ PEMF CBO  
    ◦ Sauna Blanket CBO  
    ◦ Body Care + Supplements ABO  
• As we get more ad sets and creative batches into the CBO campaigns we will be adding in ad set minimum spends in order to balance funneling spend to new concepts/creatives and letting Meta’s algorithm do it’s thing   
• Only pending campaign now is the Bundle campaign which we will have live later this week, just want to reorganize some of the legacy creatives in order to get this fully built out. TLDR it will be one campaign with specific ad sets for each bundle as discussed
- **2025-07-09 14:25** *(unknown:U05KD2RULPN)*: I promise im done mansplaining now just lmk if you have any questions!
    - **2025-07-09 15:04** *Jourdan*: Thank you for the update <@U05KD2RULPN>!
    - **2025-07-09 15:04** *Jourdan*: I’m excited to see how the account responds
    - **2025-07-09 15:19** *Jourdan*: Hey <@U029WD39C0Z> Just following up on this to see if you heard anything back?
    - **2025-07-09 15:20** *(unknown:U05KD2RULPN)*: Of course!
    - **2025-07-09 15:49** *Ari Murray (@ari)*: we haven’t yet - <@U05KD2RULPN> has the ask with our contact! we’ll keep pushing 
    - **2025-07-09 16:54** *Jourdan*: Thank you for the update!
- **2025-07-11 12:21** *Ingrid*: hey - do you guys know what happened on July 8 last year? crazy big day and I can't see why
- **2025-07-11 12:22** *Berkeley Clark (@berkeley)*: Checking on this and report back in just a sec! 
- **2025-07-11 12:53** *Berkeley Clark (@berkeley)*: Looking into it a bit further as there wasn't any special creative launched, although Meta saw a really great performance day that day
- **2025-07-11 12:53** *Berkeley Clark (@berkeley)*: Cross checking with Hannah across CRM to see if there were any special sends
- **2025-07-11 12:55** *Ingrid*: ok thanks, yea it's a weird one
- **2025-07-11 12:56** *Ingrid*: the spike happened at 10pm EST that day
- **2025-07-11 12:57** *Ingrid*: 
- **2025-07-11 16:08** *Berkeley Clark (@berkeley)*: We didn't find anything remarkable on the sales side either -- we also don't have full access to the orders/customers so can't dig too deeply but wondering if we can track down based on who the customers were and their OG touchpoints
- **2025-07-11 16:08** *Berkeley Clark (@berkeley)*: My first thought was it was one big order but looks like the quantity of orders in that hour was high too
- **2025-07-11 16:57** *Jourdan*: Hey <@U05KD2RULPN> how are you feeling about the restructure? Red Light Hat, Mask, and Body Care seem to be strongest performers
- **2025-07-11 16:58** *Jourdan*: we are in the week of Prime Day so ecosystem is tough and could be losing sales to Amz
- **2025-07-11 16:59** *(unknown:U05KD2RULPN)*: Feeling good overall! We actually got a ton of red light mask and PEMF mat creative live in the past 24 hours to set us up for the weekend- excited to get a weekend worth of data!!
- **2025-07-11 17:01** *Jourdan*: Beautiful, would love to see a resurgence on PEMF and Sauna Blanket. We’re down on rev YoY for those two products and paid performance has been rough on them so we’ll be hammering creative on the core 4 for a bit to get things turned around. I’m looking forward to the weekend
- **2025-07-11 17:01** *(unknown:U05KD2RULPN)*: Totally agree- with an emphasis on that and more bundle content going live early next week we should be trending well
- **2025-07-11 17:02** *Jourdan*: Awesome man thanks for the updates. If you need anything let me know i’ll be around all weekend!
- **2025-07-11 17:03** *(unknown:U05KD2RULPN)*: Will do!! Happy Friday 
- **2025-07-11 17:06** *Ingrid*: Thanks team!
- **2025-07-15 12:56** *Ingrid*: <!channel> hot off the presses from Bark
- **2025-07-15 12:57** *Ingrid*: 
- **2025-07-15 12:58** *Ingrid*: basically all this means is we make wayyyy more $$ (higher conversion and higher AOV) from these specific bundles. I know we are standing up the bundles campaign (is that done yet?) and let's absolutely put gas toward these. Even if we double the traffic and cut the cvr in half, we are making $$
- **2025-07-15 13:49** *Ari Murray (@ari)*: we'll get back to you here - <@U05KD2RULPN> or <@U04PHVC4WJH> to confirm status of bundle campaign  
  
def looks promising on the sets / bundles though are at smaller scale / not included as TOF so will be interesting to watch the trends move. we'll action more bundle creatives to pair with this new spend plan (<@U014QPT7LCE> is already on it)
- **2025-07-15 13:50** *(unknown:U05KD2RULPN)*: Bundle campaign will be live before EOD!
- **2025-07-15 15:29** *(unknown:U05KD2RULPN)*: <@U0913R7KB7E> sorry for the late follow up here but for Disruptors/In Market generally the threshold is $20 million in ad spend over a year
- **2025-06-16 15:40** *Ingrid*: Starting a new smaller group slack with Jourdan
- **2025-06-16 15:40** *Ingrid*: ok - can we do $1.6 (total) in July on $350k spend?
- **2025-06-16 15:41** *Ingrid*: without a July4, but with the option to pulse a flash late month if needed
- **2025-06-16 16:45** *Berkeley Clark (@berkeley)*: We think the goal is strong but within reach!

- **2025-06-24 13:09** *Berkeley Clark (@berkeley)*: Will double check on this and remove if we still have!
- **2025-06-25 11:09** *Ingrid*: <@U014QPT7LCE> do you have time today to go through selects with me from the photo shoot?

- **2025-07-09 14:25** *Rahul*: • Along with legacy ASC/DABA campaigns, we have also turned off the retention campaign. It was on the wrong attribution window and it’s one of the lower performing campaigns L30 and beyond, we can refresh this with new customer lists in the near future but for now while we have a ton in learning best to have this inactive  
• Current Setup:  
    ◦ Red Light Mask CBO  
    ◦ Red Light Hat CBO  
    ◦ PEMF CBO  
    ◦ Sauna Blanket CBO  
    ◦ Body Care + Supplements ABO  
• As we get more ad sets and creative batches into the CBO campaigns we will be adding in ad set minimum spends in order to balance funneling spend to new concepts/creatives and letting Meta’s algorithm do it’s thing   
• Only pending campaign now is the Bundle campaign which we will have live later this week, just want to reorganize some of the legacy creatives in order to get this fully built out. TLDR it will be one campaign with specific ad sets for each bundle as discussed
- **2025-07-09 14:25** *Rahul*: I promise im done mansplaining now just lmk if you have any questions!
    - **2025-07-09 15:04** *Jourdan*: Thank you for the update <@U05KD2RULPN>!
    - **2025-07-09 15:04** *Jourdan*: I’m excited to see how the account responds
    - **2025-07-09 15:19** *Jourdan*: Hey <@U029WD39C0Z> Just following up on this to see if you heard anything back?
    - **2025-07-09 15:20** *Rahul*: Of course!
    - **2025-07-09 15:49** *Ari Murray (@ari)*: we haven’t yet - <@U05KD2RULPN> has the ask with our contact! we’ll keep pushing 
    - **2025-07-09 16:54** *Jourdan*: Thank you for the update!
- **2025-07-11 12:21** *Ingrid*: hey - do you guys know what happened on July 8 last year? crazy big day and I can't see why
- **2025-07-11 12:22** *Berkeley Clark (@berkeley)*: Checking on this and report back in just a sec! 
- **2025-07-11 12:53** *Berkeley Clark (@berkeley)*: Looking into it a bit further as there wasn't any special creative launched, although Meta saw a really great performance day that day
- **2025-07-11 12:53** *Berkeley Clark (@berkeley)*: Cross checking with Hannah across CRM to see if there were any special sends
- **2025-07-11 12:55** *Ingrid*: ok thanks, yea it's a weird one
- **2025-07-11 12:56** *Ingrid*: the spike happened at 10pm EST that day
- **2025-07-11 12:57** *Ingrid*: 
- **2025-07-11 16:08** *Berkeley Clark (@berkeley)*: We didn't find anything remarkable on the sales side either -- we also don't have full access to the orders/customers so can't dig too deeply but wondering if we can track down based on who the customers were and their OG touchpoints
- **2025-07-11 16:08** *Berkeley Clark (@berkeley)*: My first thought was it was one big order but looks like the quantity of orders in that hour was high too
- **2025-07-11 16:57** *Jourdan*: Hey <@U05KD2RULPN> how are you feeling about the restructure? Red Light Hat, Mask, and Body Care seem to be strongest performers
- **2025-07-11 16:58** *Jourdan*: we are in the week of Prime Day so ecosystem is tough and could be losing sales to Amz
- **2025-07-11 16:59** *Rahul*: Feeling good overall! We actually got a ton of red light mask and PEMF mat creative live in the past 24 hours to set us up for the weekend- excited to get a weekend worth of data!!
- **2025-07-11 17:01** *Jourdan*: Beautiful, would love to see a resurgence on PEMF and Sauna Blanket. We’re down on rev YoY for those two products and paid performance has been rough on them so we’ll be hammering creative on the core 4 for a bit to get things turned around. I’m looking forward to the weekend
- **2025-07-11 17:01** *Rahul*: Totally agree- with an emphasis on that and more bundle content going live early next week we should be trending well
- **2025-07-11 17:02** *Jourdan*: Awesome man thanks for the updates. If you need anything let me know i’ll be around all weekend!
- **2025-07-11 17:03** *Rahul*: Will do!! Happy Friday 
- **2025-07-11 17:06** *Ingrid*: Thanks team!
- **2025-07-15 12:56** *Ingrid*: <!channel> hot off the presses from Bark
- **2025-07-15 12:57** *Ingrid*: 
- **2025-07-15 12:58** *Ingrid*: basically all this means is we make wayyyy more $$ (higher conversion and higher AOV) from these specific bundles. I know we are standing up the bundles campaign (is that done yet?) and let's absolutely put gas toward these. Even if we double the traffic and cut the cvr in half, we are making $$
- **2025-07-15 13:49** *Ari Murray (@ari)*: we'll get back to you here - <@U05KD2RULPN> or <@U04PHVC4WJH> to confirm status of bundle campaign  
  
def looks promising on the sets / bundles though are at smaller scale / not included as TOF so will be interesting to watch the trends move. we'll action more bundle creatives to pair with this new spend plan (<@U014QPT7LCE> is already on it)
- **2025-07-15 13:50** *Rahul*: Bundle campaign will be live before EOD!
- **2025-07-15 15:29** *Rahul*: <@U0913R7KB7E> sorry for the late follow up here but for Disruptors/In Market generally the threshold is $20 million in ad spend over a year
    - **2025-07-15 22:48** *Jourdan*: Okay cool cool that's a solid goal
