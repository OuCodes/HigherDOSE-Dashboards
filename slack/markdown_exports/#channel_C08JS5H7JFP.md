**Core Brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPC's have normalized last week as expected, being the week after Mother's Day week  
• **[dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com) still bidding high** on our **brand terms surpassing the max. impression share** we've provided them for the second week in a row. We should ideally escalate ASAP!   
• [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) still having a relatively high impression share  
**Sauna Blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• CPC's have dropped last week as expected, being the week after Mother's Day week. It fell below the general average of ~$3.6 - $4.  
• While we managed to improve our impression share over the last 2 weeks, so has [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com). So did [instyle.com](http://instyle.com) and [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) over last week.  
• We also launched new Sharma ad copy under this non-brand ad group on 5/15 and are hoping to see some good impression share results over the next few weeks.    
**Red Light Hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• CPC's have normalized last week as expected, being the week after Mother's Day week  
• Market leaders [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) managed to improve impression share quite a bit last week along with us.   
**PEMF Mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• CPCs have remained elevated last week, in contrast to other search ad groups, and are likely to stay high this week and the next due to MDW  
• We have lost impression share last week although we were gaining in the previous two weeks (probably due to high spending for MD sale). Competitors like [oxfordmedicals.com](http://oxfordmedicals.com), [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com), [magnawavepemf.com](http://magnawavepemf.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) have gained IS quite a bit last week. To address this, new ad copy will be prioritized for this ad group next week (after the MDW sale). Aiming to share for review by end of next week. cc: @User*7DB7H9 @User*PT7LCE

**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• CPC's interestingly fell well below average last week!   
• This might be due to several factors:  
    ◦ Competitors like [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) losing impression share  
    ◦ Our impression share improving to over 99%   
    ◦ Last week, despite scaling brand search (along with all other campaigns) for the MDW sale, our spending for core brand terms reduced while clicks increased. This means we drove very efficient brand clicks due to our promo last week.   
• [dermstore.com](http://dermstore.com) is still having an impression share that's higher than 20% for our brand terms (at 32.21%), although, it didn't have much of an impact on our costs last week due to points mentioned above. We'll evaluate their impression share and the impact on our CPCs next week and report back on where they stand and if they are still influencing our brand search costs.  
• Finally, we didn't notice other brands receiving an impression share against our brand terms last week despite running offers with certain retailers.  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• CPCs increased last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• Interestingly, competitor impression share dropped last week and our impression share grew, which was quite a positive trend to see!   
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• CPCs increased last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• Market leaders ([irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com)) as well as HD and [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com), were able to improve impression share last week.  
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• CPCs remained high last week as expected gearing up to MDW as many brands including HD were scaling while running promos.  
• On a positive note, our impression share grew with scaling and we were able to beat out competitors that were catching up to us the week before last.   
• **New Sharma ad copy for PEMF** aimed at improving ad relevance / quality scores and impression share will be shared for review **this week.** [cc: @User_7DB7H9] This copy will help us maintain a good impression share vs. competitors going into an evergreen period while scaling down campaigns.

- **2025-06-04 14:25** *Jake Panzer*: Hi @User*FED08G @User*M6DHLK, here's a quick recap from today’s ***Google tag call:***  
• **Google Ads tracking** is confirmed to be working correctly via a test purchase.  
• For **GA4 tracking**, the rep said the current setup is fine, but asked us to check with your dev team / the team that set it up:  
    ◦ If they’re happy with the existing setup and recommend we continue with it. In this case, no further action is needed.  
    ◦ If they prefer / recommend switching to the new Shopify Google &amp; YouTube app setup. In this case, we can proceed—but we’ll need to **remove the current setup** to avoid duplicate conversions *afterwards*.  
Let me know what your team recommends. Also, it's important to not remove any set ups as of now, until we hear back from the team on the above.

- **2025-06-04 15:52** *Jake Panzer* 💬 4 replies: Hey @User_M6DHLK, given the reduced paid media budget this month, we don’t currently have the capacity to test into Demand Gen/YouTube—though we’re definitely eager to explore it, as we believe it has strong potential!  
Right now, the entire Google budget is being used to support existing campaigns, so there’s no room to layer in YouTube within the current allocation.  
Google recommends a **$500/day** minimum for meaningful results (≈**$15K/month**), but if we want to stay budget-conscious, we could start with **$300/day** (≈**$9K/month**).  
Let us know if this incremental budget for YT is possible for June, or if you'd prefer we revisit it next month.  
Thanks! cc: @Ari Murray @Berkeley Clark
- **2025-06-05 09:58** *Jake Panzer*: Hey @User*M6DHLK and @User*FED08G, sharing through the weekly **search impression share insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms :relaxed:  
  
**Core brand (screenshot 1)**  
• Our impression share dropped off a bit last week (Generally 95%+ but last week it came down to 85%+). This is a result of us scaling down significantly last week to maintain efficiency during the last few days of the sale.   
• No cause for concern here since over the L7D, impression share is once again up to a 97.23% as we returned to an evergreen state.   
• Also happy to report that over the last two weeks, CPCs have trended down vs. evergreen (generally around $3). This could be the impact of us pushing dermstore to reduce bids and budgets for our brand keywords. cc: @User_FED08G   
**General non-brand insights**  
• CPCs are still high last week vs. evergreen. This was expected due to most MDW sales bleeding into last week (high ad auction competition during MD).   
• We're expecting CPCs to drop off from this week (6/2) as we return to a fully evergreen state.  
**Sauna blanket non-brand (screenshot 2)**  
• Over the last 4 weeks, [hydragun.com](http://hydragun.com) seems to have improved their impression share which could be an indicator that they are bidding more into / scaling into sauna blanket terms, especially during sale periods.   
• Nevertheless, we're still the market leader and we expect to stay at this level as we return to an evergreen state while also having launched new ad copy which seems to be performing better vs. older copy.   
• We'll also ensure to scale if required to maintain our position as the market leader.   
**Red light hat non-brand (screenshot 3)**  
• [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) still remain market leaders while [healthnews.com](http://healthnews.com) also managed to improve their impression share last week, most likely due to high spending during Memorial Day.  
• We're planning on working on new ad copy under this ad group, which should allow us to improve our impression share and catch up to the market leaders during an evergreen state.   
**PEMF mat non-brand (screenshot 4)**  
• We remain as market leaders in the space and are aiming to get copy launched soon (once approved) in order to improve our impression share further over the next few weeks.

- **2025-06-13 07:46** *Jake Panzer*: Hey @User*M6DHLK and @User*FED08G, sharing this week’s Google Search impression share and CPC update for brand and non-brand (product) terms :blush:  
  
**Core Brand (screenshot 1)**  
• We bounced back from the slight dip in impression share seen during the tail end of the MDW sale, now sitting strong at **97.86%** once again last week (up from 86.19% previous week).  
• What’s even better -- **CPCs dropped further** to **$1.43**, the lowest in over 2 months. This downward CPC trend started in the week of 5/19 and may still be influenced by reduced competition from Dermstore on branded terms. cc: @User*FED08G  
**Sauna Blanket Non-Brand (screenshot 2)**  
• Our **impression share improved slightly to 38.78%** last week (from 35.08% the previous week), while **CPCs dropped from $5.07 to $3.82**—a positive shift post-sale, as expected, as we head into evergreen.  
• [Hydragun.com](http://Hydragun.com) remains aggressive, still above 30% IS, but we’re continuing to lead. New Sharma copy may be helping us stay in the lead here.  
**Red Light Hat Non-Brand (screenshot 3)**  
• Impression share dipped to **15.53%** last week (vs. 19.04% the previous week), likely from the effects of returning to an evergreen state *with reduced budgets_ in June.  
• **CPCs came down slightly** from $7.71 to **$6.90**, which is a step in the right direction post-sale but we expect it to reduce further / normalize over the next few weeks during evergreen.   
**PEMF Mat Non-Brand (screenshot 4)**  
• Holding relatively steady with a **22.10% impression share**, just a minor drop from last week.  
• **CPCs also dropped** to **$5.01**, down from $5.82 post sale, as expected. We expect this to reduce further / normalize over the next few weeks during evergreen.   
• Thanks for approving the new PEMF search copy. Once this is launched, we expect to improve IS and improve our lead against competitors.

- **2025-06-24 10:04** *User_TS27JN*: Hi team- we ran out of time today, so here are our tiktok updates for the last week!  
  
**Tiktok Performance L7 (6/16-6/22)**  
1DC Northbeam  
$6,760 (NC)  
ROAS: 0.18 (+251% WoW)  
Revenue: $1,220 (+250% WoW)  
CAC: $2,250 (-66.73% WoW)  
  
Updates and next steps  
• The low AOV product funnel is fully built out and has been spending since Friday  
    ◦ NB shows a .11 roas overall with a .21 roas in the retargeting ad group. This has started off slowly and we’re making adjustments this week. If we do not see significant improvement by the end of the week we’ll look to end this test   
• Our next test is to focus heavily on the high aov products as opposed to the low aov ones and segment these out closely  
• We are preparing to move body sculpt to a conversion focused campaign in July as well. The traffic campaign has been excellent so far with a .22 CPC and a CTR of 2.62.

For these columns, conversions are attributed in a similar way to how paid social platforms like Meta attributes conversions, which gives a better picture on the true performance/impact of a Demand Gen campaigns.

- **2025-06-28 05:29** *Jake Panzer* 💬 2 replies: Hey @User*M6DHLK and @User*FED08G, apologies for the delay here. Sharing through our weekly **search impression share insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms.  
  
**Core Brand - Screenshot 1**  
• Impression share dropped to 91.91% in week 6/9. Correlates to scaling down post Father's Day sale on Jun 10.   
• Rose to **94.40% last week** most likely as a response to scaling back up based on Google rep recommendations   
• Staying strong above 90% for 7 of the past 8 weeks.  
• CPCs remain very efficient at **$1.68**, down significantly from early May highs. It has been under $2 since week 5/19 -- correlates to when dermstore confirmed they've been bidding less on our brand terms.   
• Key competitors (**Dermstore**, **Hydragun**) have pulled back / lost impression share over the last couple of weeks.  
• Amazon however increased their impression share over the last 2 weeks  
• Brand terms are well-defended with low CPCs, high impression share :white*check*mark:  
**Sauna Blanket (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 2**  
• Impression share rose to **33.41% last week**, recovering slightly from previous week’s dip -- most likely due to scaling down in week 6/9 and scaling back up in week 6/16.  
• CPCs dropped to **$4.66 last week**, down from $5.38 (Father's Day Sale week, 5/9) — a good sign of improving efficiency during an evergreen state although it hasn't reached true evergreen levels yet.  
• **Hydragun** remains our main competitor but is also trending down. **Amazon** managed to gain impression share over the last two weeks.  
• We have a decent lead, but still below May peak. This is most likely as we've scaled down dramatically in June.   
**Red Light Hat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 3**  
• **iRestore** and **Kiierr** continue to dominate the space.  
• Our share edged up to **11.41% last week**, but still far below the **31%** peak in week 5/9, likely due to scaling down significantly in June.  
• CPCs improved to **$6.08 last week**, down from over $10 in week 4/28. Slowly stabilizing post sales although it hasn't reached true evergreen levels yet.   
• **New Red Light Hat search copy** was launched this week and we expect to see an improvement in our share over the next few weeks.   
**PEMF Mat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 4**  
• Slight rise in share to **21.43% last week**, but still below earlier highs. Competitors, **Magnawavepemf** and **Healthnews** gaining ground. Likely due to scaling down significantly in June.  
• **New PEMF search copy** launched this week and we expect to see an improvement in our share over the next few weeks. We should also ideally think of scaling here to recapture impression share.   
• CPCs stable at **$5.05**, within recent averages. \n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.18.16 PM.png** (png, 418.2KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093F0GP329/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.18.16_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.18.51 PM.png** (png, 505.5KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093WFE289X/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.18.51_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.19.14 PM.png** (png, 550.7KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093F0H9W2Z/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.19.14_pm.png)\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 11.19.34 PM.png** (png, 524.0KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TKAF9UATA-F093BF2SGQN/screenshot_2025-06-26_at_11.19.34_pm.png)

**Spend: $6,200**  
**Revenue: $804**  
**ROAS: .13** (-35.58%)  
**CAC: $3,100 (+30.90%)**   
Updates and next steps  
• The body sculpt focused funnel has started off well both in platform and in NB.  
    ◦ In platform: 4.54 ROAS $73 CAC  
    ◦ NB clicks only: .68 ROAS   
    ◦ Awareness metrics: 62.3% LP view rate, .72 CPC. We will look to refresh this campaign to keep driving these metrics   
• In the pipeline is our full high aov product funnel  
    ◦ We'll launch this if body sculpt falls off/budget supports!  
Traffic campaigns in June (Roughly 12% of spend this week)  
• .35 CPC, 1.56% CTR and a Landing page view rate 66.14%  
[Creative Report](https://projects.motionapp.com/snapshot/1c57f4ef-091a-473c-9802-ac496beffacb)  
• 027 V4 is our top performer in platform and on NB. The sound and text overlay are both key factors here. The background sound is consistent in the top performing body sculpt creatives 
- **2025-07-09 09:09** *Jake Panzer*: Hey @User*M6DHLK and @User*FED08G, sharing through our **search impression share and CPC insights** for brand and non-brand (product) terms.  
  
**Core Brand - Screenshot 1**  
• Defending brand terms very well with an impression share consistently over 90%, over the last 8+ weeks.  
• [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) and [healthyline.com](http://healthyline.com) have increased impression share over the last 4 weeks, indicating higher bidding on our brand terms.   
**Sauna Blanket (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 2**  
• Defending market share well - still the market leader. [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) is our main competitor in the space.   
• CPCs seem to be normalizing over the last 3 weeks, showcasing a slow return to an evergreen state  
**Red Light Hat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 3**  
• Market leaders [irestorelaser.com](http://irestorelaser.com) and [kiierr.com](http://kiierr.com) have seen a significant drop in impression share over the last 2 weeks. Possibly due to scaling down drastically post promos. Showcases a need to scale significantly during sale periods to remain competitive with them.  
• Competitors like [schoolofdermatology.com](http://schoolofdermatology.com) and [omniluxled.com](http://omniluxled.com) have managed to improve their share in the space and a new competitor has entered the auction house ([hoogahealth.com](http://hoogahealth.com))   
• We want to scale this campaign by 20% this week to assess if we can capture some additional impression share, traffic and conversions.   
**PEMF Mat (Non-Brand / Product-Specific) - Screenshot 4**  
• We remain market leaders in the space despite scaling down drastically in June. This indicates strong performance during evergreen periods. We also recently launched new ad copy under the PEMF ad group aimed at improving quality scores and impression share which seems to be working well in defending our share.   
• [magnawavepemf.com](http://magnawavepemf.com) remains our biggest competitor in the space.   
• CPCs are dropping / stabilizing, indicating a slow return to an evergreen state.

- **2025-07-10 09:20** *Jake Panzer* 💬 5 replies: Hey @User*M6DHLK (cc: @User*R7KB7E), we met with our Google rep Tori yesterday and here’s what we aligned on—sharing for visibility:  
• We’ll let the **Pmax scaling test** run for 30 days (from June 19 until July 18), then scale down any campaigns that aren’t driving incremental revenue post scale.  
 • On July 12 (after Prime Day), we’ll **increase the target ROAS** on one Pmax campaign by +15% and monitor for around 2 weeks before deciding whether to roll this out to other campaigns.  
 • **Demand Gen scaling to $500/day** will realistically need about 6 weeks for proper learning according to Tori. Let us know if you guys are down to up the budget to $500/day from the current $300/day.  
 • Waiting on Tori to confirm what the **ToF YT Reach/Traffic investment** will look like.

- **2025-07-10 10:58** *Jake Panzer*: Hey @User*R7KB7E and team, our Shopping campaign has had a bit of drop off in spends and revenue recently, so I did a little digging and noticed that *bundles* were the primary cause. I believe the bundle images which are synced to GMC showcases the evergreen offer, and because of this, GMC has disapproved those SKUs as promotional imagery is not allowed in Google Shopping placements. Would you guys be able to provide <mailto:rahul@sharmabrands.com|rahul@sharmabrands.com> and <mailto:berkeley@sharmabrands.com|berkeley@sharmabrands.com> admin access to your GMC, and also provide us alternate image links for each bundle that's live on-site, which doesn't showcase the offer?  
Thanks in advance!

- **2025-07-18 12:07** *Jake Panzer* 💬 11 replies: Hey @Jourdan @Ingrid – sharing a quick update on the ***PMax scaling test***, since today marks the end of the 30-day test window (June 19 to July 17).  
  
*Overall, scaling results look promising.*  
**Here’s a breakdown based on *Northbeam 1DC data* (Jun 19–Jul 17 vs. previous period):**  
• *Non-Brand PEMF PMax* up 131% in revenue | 1.68 ROAS (+20%) | *NB 1DC*  
• *Non-Brand Sauna Blanket PMax* up 40% in revenue | 1.60 ROAS (-33%) | *NB 1DC*  
• *Non-Brand Red Light PMax* up 43% in revenue | 1.58 ROAS (+1%) | *NB 1DC*  
Note: The previous period included the *Body Sculptor launch and Father’s Day sale*, so we’re comparing against an inflated baseline.  
  
**From *Google in-platform data for Pmax* (Jun 19–Jul 10 vs. previous period):**  
• Impressions up 19%  
• Clicks up +35%  
• CTR up +14%  
• CPV down -14%  
• Revenue down -41% (likely due to the stronger comparison period)  
The drop in CPV supports what Google mentioned about PMax leaning more into *Top-of-Funnel placements like YouTube*, which helps build awareness efficiently.  
  
***Recommendation:***  
Let’s maintain current PMax budget levels, given the incremental revenue in 3 of the 5 scaled campaigns and clear improvements in traffic quality.  
  
***Budget note*** cc: @Jourdan @Ingrid:  
We’re currently pacing about **$30K over the $100K Google budget** for July. This was expected, as we committed to running the **30-day PMax scaling test** through its full cycle.  
We’ve noticed that the **influencer platform is under-pacing** against July budgets. Let us know if we can reallocate from there to help absorb the Google overage.  
If you’d like us to **scale further into top-performing PMax campaigns**, we’re happy to — but we’d need an **additional ~$2,800** for the rest of the month to do so.  
Let us know how you'd like us to move forward.  
Thanks! cc: @Berkeley Clark @Rahul @Ari Murray
- **2025-07-18 13:29** *Jourdan*: Hey @Jake Panzer thank you for the update and all the context that’s super helpful.  
  
We’re still down 9% YoY and since Google is the primary channel we don’t want to pull back if anything I want to keep pushing budgets on Google since we’re down 23% in spend Last 7.  
  
Do you have insights into why budget is pulling back?  
  
  
CC: @Rahul I also see some under performing campaigns on Meta like PEMF and Sauna Blanket that we could reduce spend on, shift budget to other performing campaigns, or shift the budget to google.  
  
I’d love to know both of your thoughts so we can keep pushing revenue up.  
  
I know we’re up against a few challenges compared to last year but we’re not too far behind on rev.\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
    - **2025-07-18 13:32** *Rahul*: ↳ Read my mind @Jourdan - just published our last retargeting ad set and optimizing the budget as we speak! I'll shoot over the new budget shortly
    - **2025-07-18 13:34** *Jourdan*: ↳ Thank you sir! What else besides creative do you think would be helpful to get those 2 products performing again?
    - **2025-07-18 13:35** *Rahul*: ↳ Honestly for the time being it's all creative! new campaign is still less than 2 weeks old and i think getting some new batches in will make a huge difference
    - **2025-07-18 13:35** *Rahul*: ↳ Updated budget $3075/day @Jourdan!
    - **2025-07-18 13:45** *Jourdan*: ↳ Okay thanks for that @Rahul  
  
@Jake Panzer that’ll give you more than the $2800 of wiggle room on Google. With a continued push in spend do you think’ll it will exceed what Jake cut?
    - **2025-07-18 13:46** *Jourdan*: ↳ Thanks for the update @Rahul!\n\n*Reactions: :saluting_face: Rahul, Ingrid*
