- **2025-01-10 12:16** *Ingrid*: this is where we connect on all things marketing and align as a team
- **2025-01-10 12:17** *Ingrid*: here is the link to the Q1 planning deck we just reviewed

- **2025-01-13 11:04** *User_8ASVCJ*: I think we should do some channel clean up -- the other marketing channel was actually created by phil. should we sunset that one and recreate as a general/internal team slack? the current general has 58 members and think it would be good to have one thats core team + owned by an HD user

- **2025-01-13 11:06** *Elyse*: hi all - can likely close down general channel too
- **2025-01-13 11:07** *Elyse*: a lot of old/inactive team members on that one
- **2025-01-13 11:07** *Elyse* 💬 1 reply: and anything general we typically use the customer support channel anyway
- **2025-01-13 11:11** *User_8ASVCJ*: For everyone who asked-- I created [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pWZM8FmhA5-vyX12cf5OJK1bxTuJG5TQTmsZNBy6Qw0/edit?usp=sharing) with friends + friend's families go fund me links for direct aid which i'll unfortunately have to update to include more today.  
  
There's a second tab which is comprised of other lists for direct aid.  
  
The third tab is something I'm working on which is links to help people apply for/request aid in case anyone knows where else people can request aid outside of applying for Fema. -- I posted a "how to get started with filing a claim" on my personal account for those insured, but really want to help those who aren't apply for financial aid.\n\n*Reactions: :heartpulse: Elyse, Sajel Mistry, Ingrid*
- **2025-01-13 11:19** *User_8ASVCJ*: With LA being one of ur top locations -- One content piece that i think we can do is around supplements/natural remedies to help detox from the toxic smoke which should include general tips so it's not all specific to HD products, but can also lean into the ingredients in our detox drops, highdration powder, etc.  
  
i really liked the contents of this post for reference:\n\n📎 **IMG_2561.PNG** (png, 3.3MB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F088ERWA935/img_2561.png)

- **2025-02-13 10:23** *Anastasia*: This was an interesting interview and possible a good cue to bring back focus to our Facebook community group again.  
  
Interview with the CEO of Portland Leather Goods who in the last 10 years went from $400,000 in sales to $200,000,000 in sales p/y.  
**"1. NOT Your Story**   
  
We’re not the story. Our customers are the story. That’s the biggest change we’ve ever made.  
Our Insiders Facebook group is the best embodiment of this truth — 150k strong. We’re accepting hundreds of posts a day, getting thousands of reactions. When we post a video? Within a couple of hours, it has 50,000 views.  
Six times a year, we do over a million dollars in less than an hour. LESS THAN ONE HOUR!  
$6.5M a year, and you can only buy if you’re in that group.  
Why does it work? Because if you go shopping and the person selling to you says, “You look good in that,” you don’t believe them. But if your FRIEND says it? You’re sold."

- **2025-03-06 18:29** *Anastasia*: <!channel> interesting point out and something we need to keep in mind when sharing content.  
From Dr Alissa Vitti:  
**Legal Note: CYCLE SYNCING® is the proprietary method developed and owned by Alisa Vitti. The term “CYCLE SYNCING” was coined by Alisa Vitti and her company, Flo Living LLC. The phrases “CYCLE SYNCING®” and “CYCLE SYNCING® METHOD” should only be used when referring to Ms. Vitti’s services and goods. When so used, the trademark registration symbol “®” should follow the trademarked term and Ms. Vitti should be credited as the originator of the phrase and the creator of the method. The term “cycle syncing” should never be used generically to refer to a type of service provided. Variations of the term such as “cycle sync” or “cycle synced” should never be used, as such uses genericize our Ms. Vitti’s registered trademark, which is improper.**  
**When referring to services provided by someone other Ms. Vitti, you should use another phrase. Acceptable alternatives include: cycle based care, cyclical living, phase based care, cycle tracking, period sync, hormone sync, monthly sync, phase sync, and/or menstrual cycle based self-care.**
- **2025-03-06 18:29** *Fiona Hillery*: Really? I thought cycle syncing was a universal term?
- **2025-03-06 18:30** *Fiona Hillery*: She has proprietary rights?
- **2025-03-06 18:30** *Anastasia*: Apparently - we are doing a blog/interview with her and she just shared this in her email along with the legal disclaimer: **One extremely important legal and journalistic note- The phrase Cycle Syncing is my registered trademark - so you can only use that particular phrase with the tm symbol and with attribution to me as the creator of this method in any and all content via email and/or social.**
- **2025-03-06 18:31** *Fiona Hillery*: Happy to use it on the blog because she is a friend of the brand but I just googled and cycle syncing is being used widespread by doctors, writers, etc. I would be interested to see the TM

- **2025-03-07 07:50** *Sajel Mistry*: Alisa told me if we use her interview then that can be the only time we use "cycle syncing." She wrote this: "My preference is that you only use the phrase for my interview and if you have other interviews/content that you use any other phrase like Cycle Phase based Biohacking tips - or something like that."
- **2025-03-07 07:51** *Sajel Mistry*: We have other blogs with cycle syncing coming up

- **2025-03-07 13:24** *Anastasia*: Since we are working with her I would make sure we credit her in some way when using the term cycle syncing. Maybe a * and then at the bottom of the email add in her conditional terms as stated above.

Even though I don't want to push shopping via AI, I do think think its a good idea for everyone to start searching some of HD's top key words on the Ai platform that they use and see what articles come up.
