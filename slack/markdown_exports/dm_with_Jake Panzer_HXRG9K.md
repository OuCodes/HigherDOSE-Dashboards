- **2025-07-10 10:01** *Jake Panzer (@jake)*: Hey Jourdan, just reaching out and giving you a heads up about our GA4 tracking setup.  
  
For context, we received a warning from Shopify that the current Google tag setup might break when they update their checkout flows around August. They recommended that we set up Google tags through the Google &amp; YouTube shopify plug in to avoid this risk. To get ahead of this, we set up a call with Google’s tag specialist team. On the call, we managed to successfully complete the new tag configuration for Google Ads, but the GA4 tracking migration is still in progress.  
  
I’ll loop you into the email thread shortly and share the next steps as I see them. Ideally, I’d love for you to act as the bridge between the Cardinal team (managing the live site and current tags) and the Annatta team (managing the new site theme and tag configuration) to carry out this migration smoothly. Does that work for you? Let me know :blush: Alternatively, I can be the bridge too but wanted to align with you first.
- **2025-07-10 13:44** *Jourdan*: Yeah man that works for me. I haven’t been introduced to either parties on site management yet so this will be a good intro for me so I have context. Thank you for aligning with me first!
- **2025-07-11 06:05** *Jake Panzer (@jake)*: Of course Jourdan! Will loop you into the thread shortly
