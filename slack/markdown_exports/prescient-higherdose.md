- **2025-07-17 13:06** *Jourdan*: Hey, im following up with Gui and need clarity around % of revenue  
  
“What percentage of your revenue comes from D2C, retail, and marketplace”  
  
W/ 36M on Shopify last 12 months I’m assuming retail and marketplace accounts are tracked off platform?  
Is it safe to say those 2 make up 20% of the total rev?\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
    - **2025-07-17 22:49** *Jourdan*: ↳ Okay sounds good @Jake Panzer send an update and i should be able to get you more spend from the other channels\n\n*Reactions: :saluting_face: Jake Panzer*
- **2025-07-18 09:19** *Chris Jacob*: **<!channel>** we have begun domain hosting transfer this may cause interruptions in a variety of ways. If you face any tech issues at all please advise me here and if I don't respond to my personal email/phone as higherdose email could be interrupted\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Rahul, Jake Panzer*
- **2025-07-18 11:11** *Jourdan*: I think the tool is valuable but felt like we weren’t strong in the same areas they are like Retail &amp; Amazon.  
  
Although seems like there might be opportunities with brij to track retail sales, do list building, and the rebate thing seemed interesting but agreed big business decision.\n\n*Reactions: :bangbang: Ari Murray*
- **2025-07-18 11:22** *Jourdan*: Also updating packaging to include or update QR codes would  be a big decision\n\n*Reactions: :bangbang: Ari Murray*
- **2025-07-18 11:22** *Jourdan*: I agree that would need to be positioned differently for it to land well\n\n*Reactions: :pray: Ari Murray*
- **2025-07-18 12:07** *Jake Panzer* 💬 11 replies: Hey @Jourdan @Ingrid – sharing a quick update on the ***PMax scaling test***, since today marks the end of the 30-day test window (June 19 to July 17).  
  
*Overall, scaling results look promising.*  
**Here’s a breakdown based on *Northbeam 1DC data* (Jun 19–Jul 17 vs. previous period):**  
• *Non-Brand PEMF PMax* up 131% in revenue | 1.68 ROAS (+20%) | *NB 1DC*  
• *Non-Brand Sauna Blanket PMax* up 40% in revenue | 1.60 ROAS (-33%) | *NB 1DC*  
• *Non-Brand Red Light PMax* up 43% in revenue | 1.58 ROAS (+1%) | *NB 1DC*  
Note: The previous period included the *Body Sculptor launch and Father’s Day sale*, so we’re comparing against an inflated baseline.  
  
**From *Google in-platform data for Pmax* (Jun 19–Jul 10 vs. previous period):**  
• Impressions up 19%  
• Clicks up +35%  
• CTR up +14%  
• CPV down -14%  
• Revenue down -41% (likely due to the stronger comparison period)  
The drop in CPV supports what Google mentioned about PMax leaning more into *Top-of-Funnel placements like YouTube*, which helps build awareness efficiently.  
  
***Recommendation:***  
Let’s maintain current PMax budget levels, given the incremental revenue in 3 of the 5 scaled campaigns and clear improvements in traffic quality.  
  
***Budget note*** cc: @Jourdan @Ingrid:  
We’re currently pacing about **$30K over the $100K Google budget** for July. This was expected, as we committed to running the **30-day PMax scaling test** through its full cycle.  
We’ve noticed that the **influencer platform is under-pacing** against July budgets. Let us know if we can reallocate from there to help absorb the Google overage.  
If you’d like us to **scale further into top-performing PMax campaigns**, we’re happy to — but we’d need an **additional ~$2,800** for the rest of the month to do so.  
Let us know how you'd like us to move forward.  
Thanks! cc: @Berkeley Clark @Rahul @Ari Murray
- **2025-07-18 13:29** *Jourdan*: Hey @Jake Panzer thank you for the update and all the context that’s super helpful.  
  
We’re still down 9% YoY and since Google is the primary channel we don’t want to pull back if anything I want to keep pushing budgets on Google since we’re down 23% in spend Last 7.  
  
Do you have insights into why budget is pulling back?  
  
  
CC: @Rahul I also see some under performing campaigns on Meta like PEMF and Sauna Blanket that we could reduce spend on, shift budget to other performing campaigns, or shift the budget to google.  
  
I’d love to know both of your thoughts so we can keep pushing revenue up.  
  
I know we’re up against a few challenges compared to last year but we’re not too far behind on rev.\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
    - **2025-07-18 13:32** *Rahul*: ↳ Read my mind @Jourdan - just published our last retargeting ad set and optimizing the budget as we speak! I'll shoot over the new budget shortly
    - **2025-07-18 13:34** *Jourdan*: ↳ Thank you sir! What else besides creative do you think would be helpful to get those 2 products performing again?
    - **2025-07-18 13:35** *Rahul*: ↳ Honestly for the time being it's all creative! new campaign is still less than 2 weeks old and i think getting some new batches in will make a huge difference
    - **2025-07-18 13:35** *Rahul*: ↳ Updated budget $3075/day @Jourdan!
    - **2025-07-18 13:45** *Jourdan*: ↳ Okay thanks for that @Rahul  
  
@Jake Panzer that’ll give you more than the $2800 of wiggle room on Google. With a continued push in spend do you think’ll it will exceed what Jake cut?
    - **2025-07-18 13:46** *Jourdan*: ↳ Thanks for the update @Rahul!\n\n*Reactions: :saluting_face: Rahul, Ingrid*
    - **2025-07-18 17:13** *Ingrid*: ↳ @Jourdan and @Rahul do we have creative in the pipeline?
