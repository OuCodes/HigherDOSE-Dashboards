As we have a few more days on the sculptor paid launch, we do want to keep things moving. We’d love for you to use [this](https://next.frame.io/project/2bec461a-9b14-4c3c-9247-e4365b115e6a/11945b34-d494-43af-910e-1ce40c6ffa8d) + [this](https://next.frame.io/project/2bec461a-9b14-4c3c-9247-e4365b115e6a/b63b0f0b-7932-49cc-a5ab-d843f12b7a7e) footage to create some sculptor content. We need:  
• PDP video of product in use   
• 15s + 30s for paid (and whatever other length you recommend)   
• Paid static ads   
We’d love for you to build us a moodboard/palate of what this will look like before going into full production on all assets. We will want to take this to be approved by founders/leadership as well.  
  
Let me know if you have q’s! Let me know if you think we can get this by later next week - 5/22?  
  
Thanks!

- **2025-06-25 11:46** *Laura*: @User_TS27JN we have submitted a couple of times to change our handle on TikTok to just HigherDOSE vs HigherDOSE Shop - do you have any ideas? 
- **2025-06-25 11:46** *Laura*: I think our handle is actually fine it’s just how our name appears? 
- **2025-06-25 11:51** *User_TS27JN*: Hey @Laura just to clarify do you mean you've submitted changing the name and have been rejected or looking for other handle ideas?  The actual handle itself appears as 'Higherdose'. I do know when we post/spark the name appears as higherdose shop to users so happy to look into changing that!
- **2025-06-25 11:51** *Laura*: Yes we need to change higherdose shop - is that an easy fix or do we need to submit again?  
- **2025-06-25 11:52** *Laura*: I wasn’t the one submitting so I’m not suuuper clear but we want our name to appear the same as our handle too and read “HigherDOSE” if we have the option to capitalize the dose 
- **2025-06-25 11:52** *Laura*: We are going to up our community engagement so also want it to reflect for that as well. Thanks!!
- **2025-06-25 12:34** *User_TS27JN*: Understood- should be a very easy switch! Please see [here](https://support.tiktok.com/en/getting-started/setting-up-your-profile/changing-your-nickname) for directions how to change it. Its a nickname assigned to the account that can be changed once every 7 days. Let me know if you run into an issue changing it and I can confirm on my end the ads changed once its tweaked!  Thank you

- **2025-07-11 14:08** *User_7DB7H9*: Hi @Laura @Ingrid! We have some creative in mind that requires a bit of sales and social proof info that we’d love to grab from you. We’ve seen these types of creatives perform not only for our own clients but for other brands and across industries as well. We'd love to get this info first for ***Red Light Mask and Hat,*** please see below and let us know if you have any questions!  
  
• How many units sold across all channels (In a year. Over the lifetime.)  
    ◦ Ex. XX products sold in YY time frame   
    ◦ Ex. Trusted by XX users (sub users for target demo - women, families, etc)  
• Has this sold out &amp; how many times? *(ex. Sold out 7x)*  
    ◦ Example - Sold out in 3 days [(Caraway BF example)](https://projects.motionapp.com/organization/64ef6978590a427cc0def5b6/creative-research/ad/925464966230427)  
• Launch Successes *(how many units sold across all platforms)*  
    ◦ What was the most successful launch to date?   
    ◦ How many products were sold in a day? (The best month or year)  
• Total customer reviews across all channels  
    ◦ Example: Amazon SS vs. regular text overlay  
We can also talk about this in next weeks creative sync as we need.

As we have a few more days on the sculptor paid launch, we do want to keep things moving. We’d love for you to use [this](https://next.frame.io/project/2bec461a-9b14-4c3c-9247-e4365b115e6a/11945b34-d494-43af-910e-1ce40c6ffa8d) + [this](https://next.frame.io/project/2bec461a-9b14-4c3c-9247-e4365b115e6a/b63b0f0b-7932-49cc-a5ab-d843f12b7a7e) footage to create some sculptor content. We need:  
• PDP video of product in use   
• 15s + 30s for paid (and whatever other length you recommend)   
• Paid static ads   
We’d love for you to build us a moodboard/palate of what this will look like before going into full production on all assets. We will want to take this to be approved by founders/leadership as well.  
  
Let me know if you have q’s! Let me know if you think we can get this by later next week - 5/22?

We need to really work on the core 4 products, so you'll see additional summer messaging in here, but different angles than the last brief. lmk if you have questions or want to review.

- **2025-07-15 15:07** *Anastasia*: @Laura this is live - @User_7DB7H9, your team should have access to her account for WL. I put 60 days usage, but we can extend if it does well.\n\n*Reactions: :eyes: User_7DB7H9*
- **2025-07-15 15:11** *User_7DB7H9* 💬 5 replies: @Anastasia could you please confirm which row this is added in your UGC Tracker? If you could please also note if we have rights to edit the content as well or if we can just run as is, please note the platform for usage and include usage rights as well. We're working to clean up our UGC process a bit, ensuring all necessary info is included in the tracker before we kick off edits or send to the paid team to be built out. Thanks AK! cc @Berkeley Clark @User_PT7LCE
