- **2021-04-26 11:39** *Chris Jacob*: Rs has asked if they can use OnTrac for some of our west coast fulfillment. Can anyone on the West Coast and/or that has close contacts there find out if this is generally "fine" on the customer side. They are a large carrier, particularly in California, equivalent in those markets to a FedEx and UPS but want to confirm this isn't an issue
- **2021-04-26 11:41** *Victoria*: @User_8P5HJ4 are you familiar with OnTrac for west coast?
- **2021-04-26 11:42** *User_8P5HJ4*: OnTrac, Axlhire etc are west coast focused delivery companies. They are great services when you have a warehouse in the west coast. If they serve from Salt Lake City its even better but I would like to check if there are any up charges for pickup from SLC. In that case UPS , FEDEX ground can be cheaper and the transit times can be similar. 
- **2021-04-26 11:45** *User_8P5HJ4*: I did a lot of work on the last mile delivery companies like these. There are a few in the east coast too. We should look into our customers/ orders distribution by state for last few months and discuss possible options. 
- **2021-04-26 11:48** *Chris Jacob*: They're the same price so if there's no customer side concern we'll go ahead. RS will only use them when they need the space
- **2021-04-26 11:49** *Chris Jacob*: Which is currently only an issue on mats on some days given their size
- **2021-04-26 11:49** *Chris Jacob*: but the issue will increase once we get into the holidays if the carriers are similarly unprepared this year
- **2021-04-26 12:01** *User_8P5HJ4*: Agreed. These last mile companies were great in the holidays. The one I used in the east coast was 98% success throughout the holidays and COVID. That was really really impressive 
- **2021-04-27 09:22** *Victoria*: hi team - still waiting on schedule for go mat - chasing today
- **2021-04-27 09:51** *Victoria*: can we discuss cult beauty today? they are hounding me about changing our website price back up to 469 euros for the blanket
- **2021-04-27 09:51** *Victoria*: we’re not doing that correct?
- **2021-04-27 09:52** *Chris Jacob*: wait are they trying to get us to increase or decrease price
- **2021-04-27 09:52** *Victoria*: increase - originally on the website we were charging 469 euros so that’s what they were charging
- **2021-04-27 09:53** *Victoria*: they negotiated hard with us and if we keep 399 USD we probably will just have to part ways from then
- **2021-04-27 09:53** *Victoria*: they are similar to goop in the UK
- **2021-04-27 09:54** *Victoria*: i thought we could do it only because we’re out of stock of purple so there is some demand
- **2021-04-27 09:54** *Victoria*: i mean black

- **2021-07-26 18:32** *Affiliates*: Hi all:
- **2021-07-26 18:32** *Affiliates*: what can we say regarding beauty benefits of sauna blank or pemf mat?
- **2021-07-26 18:32** *Affiliates*: I know we can say glowing skin
- **2021-07-26 18:33** *Affiliates*: Can we say anything about cellulite reduction appearence?
- **2021-07-26 18:33** *Affiliates*: or anything with collagen?
- **2021-07-26 18:33** *Affiliates*: anything else you can think of?
- **2021-07-26 18:34** *Affiliates*: we will have some new big skincare focused influencers/podcasts soon so want to see how to emphasize that vs the biohacking angle
- **2021-07-27 12:02** *Victoria*: pretty sure you can say increases blood flow which aids collagen production
- **2021-07-27 12:38** *Chris Jacob*: @Affiliates the key is "may" do such things
- **2021-07-27 14:10** *Affiliates*: got answer from katie
- **2021-07-27 14:12** *Affiliates*: Beauty &amp; Skincare - Cleanse pores and give you the “glow”:  For an instant glow, nothing makes the skin shine like a sweat session in an infrared sauna.
- **2021-07-27 14:12** *Affiliates*: Just one session leaves our skin softer, dewy, and more radiant, thanks to increased blood flow and circulation to the skin.
- **2021-07-27 14:12** *Affiliates*: Infrared, which increases your body’s core temperature over time, helps push deeply-embedded impurities and toxins out of the skin.
- **2021-07-27 14:13** *Affiliates*: Anti-aging: Infrared also helps stimulate collagen production and improves skin texture.
- **2021-07-27 14:13** *Affiliates*: Anti-acne: The infrared sauna detoxifies your entire body, leaving your system cleaner and less prone to acne.
- **2021-07-28 09:18** *User_69PW12*: @Affiliates I spoke with a PHD scientist regarding this and I think we can create an awesome marketing slogan around something.
- **2021-07-28 09:21** *User_69PW12*: Claims along the premise of affecting the structure or function of the skin/body would be consider a “drug” by law and come under FDA Scrutiny.  We would never want to say directly that something helps with cellulite, that pushing some boundaries with the FDA. But if we are thinking influences we can create evidence around other physiological mechanisms that influencers could use when we use seeding ect.

- **2025-06-23 15:05** *Jourdan*: Pulled from GA4 directly but not sure where SEO came from. Ingrid shared that with me so i think it may have been internal
- **2025-06-23 15:05** *Laura*: ok perf, thanks!!
- **2025-06-26 11:50** *Laura*: Do you have avails to meet tomorrow from 9am-12p pst?
- **2025-06-26 11:51** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am anytime works between 9 and 11am 
- **2025-06-26 11:52** *Laura*: Let’s do 10-10:30am tomorrow 6/27? I can send an invite in a bit 
- **2025-06-26 11:52** *Jourdan*: Okay sweet that works
- **2025-06-27 09:56** *Jourdan*: Good morning! The invite came through for 7/1 did you still want to chat today
- **2025-06-27 10:06** *Laura*: i had left a note in the invite - i have a conflict, does 7/1 work?
- **2025-06-27 10:06** *Jourdan*: Ahh okay and yes that works
- **2025-07-07 15:29** *Jourdan*: Yo do you need any insights on Top Red Light Hat or Mask Creative?
- **2025-07-07 20:48** *Laura*: Sorry i totally missed this! No I think I'm good - i'll tag you in the brief for your inputs
- **2025-07-07 20:48** *Laura*: thanks!
- **2025-07-08 00:22** *Jourdan*: Okay thank you!
- **2025-07-10 18:43** *Jourdan*: Hey, apologies for the delayed response on your brief. For Red Light Neck Enhancer, did you pick that up from the call or were there other needs for creative there? I ask because Sauna Blanket &amp; PEMF mat are down in sales rev compared to last year and we want to push those but they’re not performing well w/ paid media. I’d like to get more creative in the mix there but if that’s gonna overload SB or delay their turn around i can push to next week :eyes:
- **2025-07-10 18:46** *Laura*: yes I thought jake said neck enhancer? or maybe I made that up lol, but I think we can maybe test the mask + neck enhancer together, and we also push them together too
- **2025-07-10 18:47** *Laura*: SB is working on blanket, so we can push pemf to next week
- **2025-07-10 18:47** *Laura*: they should have red light hat too since we briefed them on the other week as well
- **2025-07-10 18:47** *Jourdan*: Okay cool that could help with AOV because that’s taken a dip as well. I’m aligned with Mask + Neck Enhancer
- **2025-07-10 18:48** *Laura* 💬 1 reply: i also started a CTV brief: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18PoqXx8mISEXosl3032aGPvW5YC3WQHanGR*sG4Bi5E/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18PoqXx8mISEXosl3032aGPvW5YC3WQHanGR*sG4Bi5E/edit?usp=sharing) but we can chat about this next week, i assume it's going to be awarness focused\n\n📎 **HD CTV Brief** (gpres, 0B) - [Download](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18PoqXx8mISEXosl3032aGPvW5YC3WQHanGR_sG4Bi5E/edit?usp=sharing)
- **2025-07-10 18:48** *Jourdan*: but yeah for sure red light hat that’s our winner
- **2025-07-10 18:48** *Laura*: are you aligned to these other products too for a refresh?\n\n📎 **Screenshot 2025-07-10 at 4.48.31 PM.png** (png, 42.8KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F095C1BF9T6/screenshot_2025-07-10_at_4.48.31___pm.png)
- **2025-07-10 18:49** *Jourdan*: Yes ma’am
- **2025-07-10 18:51** *Laura*: idk if you looked at the YT brief that carly sent through but i did think it was maybe too performanced focused? but once we have specs etc i can provide better messaging
