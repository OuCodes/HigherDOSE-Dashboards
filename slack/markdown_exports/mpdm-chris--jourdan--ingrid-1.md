- **2025-06-13 13:43** *Ingrid*: also, Motion please
- **2025-06-13 13:47** *Ingrid*: also GA4
- **2025-06-13 14:43** *Chris Jacob*: @Ingrid what google ad account # do you access i'm confused by why i dont see you in either the ad account or ad manager account but i have historically had issues granting acces in it
- **2025-06-13 14:45** *Chris Jacob*: @Jourdan what email do you prefer meta ad access through
- **2025-06-13 14:46** *Jourdan*: lets go with the work email @Chris Jacob

- **2025-06-13 14:50** *Chris Jacob* 💬 1 reply: do you only access in analytics and not [ads.google.com](http://ads.google.com)?
- **2025-06-13 14:59** *Chris Jacob*: @Jourdan let me know once you get in TT ads I have to assign additional permissions after you'r ein
- **2025-06-13 15:33** *Chris Jacob*: @Jourdan when you get the products please take some picture in and out of boxes we always like to check how warehouse did packing stuff
- **2025-06-13 15:46** *Chris Jacob*: i think i gave all access except i dont access twitter think maybe katie has?
- **2025-06-13 15:46** *Chris Jacob*: @Jourdan let me know as you encounter any roadblocks with specific permissioning
- **2025-06-16 09:58** *Chris Jacob*: <!channel>  
• We are due our periodic discussion with Northbeam but I cancelled until @Jourdan gets up to speed so let me know when you want that scheduled  
• As Applovin is new channel last week, it goes into any "total spend" setups in NB but you may need to make sure it's manually added on other dashboards if they have broken down info
- **2025-06-16 10:07** *Jourdan*: @Chris Jacob can you resend Klaviyo and Attentive invites? They have a short expiration window.  
  
I’m in TT so can assign additional permissions
- **2025-06-16 10:14** *Chris Jacob*: @Jourdan done
- **2025-06-16 10:17** *Jourdan*: Thank you sir :saluting_face:
- **2025-06-16 10:31** *Chris Jacob*: @Jourdan regarding NB, the affiliate platforms AWIN and ShopMy are non automated. My team member Josan manually inputs overnight (she's in PHP) but sometimes a lag on weekends FYI. This would result in those channels on particular days (and then total spend) being below reality.  All the paid channels are automated
- **2025-06-16 10:33** *Jourdan*: Okay thank you for the clarity on that. Something like [https://www.sarasanalytics.com/saras-daton/sources](https://www.sarasanalytics.com/saras-daton/sources) could help automate that but if those platforms are small then they may not have connectors either\n\n**sarasanalytics.com**\n🔗 **[200+ Data Connectors for Ecommerce and D2C Brands | Saras Analytics](https://www.sarasanalytics.com/saras-daton/sources)**\n> Discover 200+ plug-and-play connectors for Shopify, Amazon, Meta, TikTok, and more.

- **2025-06-16 10:34** *Chris Jacob*: Don't see them. Both are terrible at backend stuff.  AWIN fully replaced ShareaSale that they acquired at some point its a mess
- **2025-06-16 10:34** *Chris Jacob*: Josan is helpful in general if and when you find any tasks that are manual data work
- **2025-06-16 15:18** *Jourdan*: i still need access to motion, is that something you can help with? @Chris Jacob
- **2025-06-16 15:46** *Chris Jacob*: @Ingrid I still never got access to admin or anything
- **2025-06-16 15:57** *Ingrid*: lemme try
- **2025-06-16 15:58** *Ingrid*: i think i just sent you an invite - we are on together in 2 min so we can donfirm
- **2025-06-16 16:01** *Jourdan*: invite accepted :saluting_face:
- **2025-06-16 16:09** *Chris Jacob*: @Jourdan they don't let me touch creative cuz all the ads would just be a still image that says "hey if you want to buy anything let us know"
- **2025-06-16 16:18** *Ingrid*: lmao he's right
- **2025-06-18 08:00** *Chris Jacob*: also if you haven't seen there's this no idea what it means\n\n📎 **image.png** (png, 265.6KB) - [Download](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TA97020CV-F091XS2NBSN/image.png)
- **2025-06-18 09:01** *Jourdan*: Interesting, ill check it out. Probably just a UI refresh
- **2025-07-16 09:50** *Chris Jacob*: You are getting invites to Buxton, this is through elevar based on our Ga4 data they output Personas, limited in scope but Buxton is the go to in the health and wellness industry for demographic data if hepful
- **2025-07-16 12:43** *Ingrid*: yep, just signed up!
- **2025-07-16 12:44** *Ingrid*: I saw "Scount" in the workspace, what is that?
- **2025-07-16 20:56** *Chris Jacob*: where do you see that

- **2025-07-17 13:40** *Ingrid*: they are forcing a call, which i think is part of the onbaording anyway
- **2025-07-17 13:40** *Ingrid*: like it wont let me just verify
- **2025-07-17 13:40** *Ingrid* 💬 1 reply: will it let you, Jourdan?
- **2025-07-17 13:40** *Ingrid*: i accepted the inputs earlier
- **2025-07-17 13:40** *Chris Jacob*: i have ability to do so i think?

- **2025-07-17 13:41** *Ingrid*: try?
- **2025-07-17 13:42** *Chris Jacob*: goes to this but then still doesnt unlock that stuff

- **2025-07-17 13:42** *Chris Jacob*: numbers look right to me pinterest is slightly low
- **2025-07-17 13:42** *Chris Jacob*: do we need to do anything with the affilitae stuff manually? josan can enter stuff like shes already doing for Northbeam if so
- **2025-07-17 13:43** *Ingrid*: we shouldn't, but let me confirm when we meet with them
- **2025-07-17 13:43** *Ingrid*: pinterest was turned off/down for low performance so that makes sense
- **2025-07-17 13:46** *Chris Jacob*: was referring to mismatch in this time period but its actually northbeam thats lower than prescient, which matches the platform\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-17 13:48** *Jourdan*: Yeah NB would be lower than prescient because NB wasn’t implemented last year\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-17 13:57** *Ingrid*: yay for new toys
    - **2025-07-17 22:49** *Jourdan*: ↳ Okay sounds good @Jake Panzer send an update and i should be able to get you more spend from the other channels\n\n*Reactions: :saluting_face: Jake Panzer*
- **2025-07-18 09:19** *Chris Jacob*: **<!channel>** we have begun domain hosting transfer this may cause interruptions in a variety of ways. If you face any tech issues at all please advise me here and if I don't respond to my personal email/phone as higherdose email could be interrupted\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Rahul, Jake Panzer*
- **2025-07-18 11:11** *Jourdan*: I think the tool is valuable but felt like we weren’t strong in the same areas they are like Retail &amp; Amazon.  
  
Although seems like there might be opportunities with brij to track retail sales, do list building, and the rebate thing seemed interesting but agreed big business decision.\n\n*Reactions: :bangbang: Ari Murray*
- **2025-07-18 11:22** *Jourdan*: Also updating packaging to include or update QR codes would  be a big decision\n\n*Reactions: :bangbang: Ari Murray*
- **2025-07-18 11:22** *Jourdan*: I agree that would need to be positioned differently for it to land well\n\n*Reactions: :pray: Ari Murray*
- **2025-07-18 12:07** *Jake Panzer* 💬 11 replies: Hey @Jourdan @Ingrid – sharing a quick update on the ***PMax scaling test***, since today marks the end of the 30-day test window (June 19 to July 17).  
  
*Overall, scaling results look promising.*  
**Here’s a breakdown based on *Northbeam 1DC data* (Jun 19–Jul 17 vs. previous period):**  
• *Non-Brand PEMF PMax* up 131% in revenue | 1.68 ROAS (+20%) | *NB 1DC*  
• *Non-Brand Sauna Blanket PMax* up 40% in revenue | 1.60 ROAS (-33%) | *NB 1DC*  
• *Non-Brand Red Light PMax* up 43% in revenue | 1.58 ROAS (+1%) | *NB 1DC*  
Note: The previous period included the *Body Sculptor launch and Father’s Day sale*, so we’re comparing against an inflated baseline.  
  
**From *Google in-platform data for Pmax* (Jun 19–Jul 10 vs. previous period):**  
• Impressions up 19%  
• Clicks up +35%  
• CTR up +14%  
• CPV down -14%  
• Revenue down -41% (likely due to the stronger comparison period)  
The drop in CPV supports what Google mentioned about PMax leaning more into *Top-of-Funnel placements like YouTube*, which helps build awareness efficiently.  
  
***Recommendation:***  
Let’s maintain current PMax budget levels, given the incremental revenue in 3 of the 5 scaled campaigns and clear improvements in traffic quality.  
  
***Budget note*** cc: @Jourdan @Ingrid:  
We’re currently pacing about **$30K over the $100K Google budget** for July. This was expected, as we committed to running the **30-day PMax scaling test** through its full cycle.  
We’ve noticed that the **influencer platform is under-pacing** against July budgets. Let us know if we can reallocate from there to help absorb the Google overage.  
If you’d like us to **scale further into top-performing PMax campaigns**, we’re happy to — but we’d need an **additional ~$2,800** for the rest of the month to do so.  
Let us know how you'd like us to move forward.  
Thanks! cc: @Berkeley Clark @Rahul @Ari Murray
- **2025-07-18 13:29** *Jourdan*: Hey @Jake Panzer thank you for the update and all the context that’s super helpful.  
  
We’re still down 9% YoY and since Google is the primary channel we don’t want to pull back if anything I want to keep pushing budgets on Google since we’re down 23% in spend Last 7.  
  
Do you have insights into why budget is pulling back?  
  
  
CC: @Rahul I also see some under performing campaigns on Meta like PEMF and Sauna Blanket that we could reduce spend on, shift budget to other performing campaigns, or shift the budget to google.  
  
I’d love to know both of your thoughts so we can keep pushing revenue up.  
  
I know we’re up against a few challenges compared to last year but we’re not too far behind on rev.\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
    - **2025-07-18 13:32** *Rahul*: ↳ Read my mind @Jourdan - just published our last retargeting ad set and optimizing the budget as we speak! I'll shoot over the new budget shortly
    - **2025-07-18 13:34** *Jourdan*: ↳ Thank you sir! What else besides creative do you think would be helpful to get those 2 products performing again?
    - **2025-07-18 13:35** *Rahul*: ↳ Honestly for the time being it's all creative! new campaign is still less than 2 weeks old and i think getting some new batches in will make a huge difference
    - **2025-07-18 13:35** *Rahul*: ↳ Updated budget $3075/day @Jourdan!
    - **2025-07-18 13:45** *Jourdan*: ↳ Okay thanks for that @Rahul  
  
@Jake Panzer that’ll give you more than the $2800 of wiggle room on Google. With a continued push in spend do you think’ll it will exceed what Jake cut?
    - **2025-07-18 13:46** *Jourdan*: ↳ Thanks for the update @Rahul!\n\n*Reactions: :saluting_face: Rahul, Ingrid*
    - **2025-07-18 17:13** *Ingrid*: ↳ @Jourdan and @Rahul do we have creative in the pipeline?

- **2025-07-17 13:43** *Ingrid*: we shouldn't, but let me confirm when we meet with them
- **2025-07-17 13:43** *Ingrid*: pinterest was turned off/down for low performance so that makes sense
- **2025-07-17 13:46** *Chris Jacob*: was referring to mismatch in this time period but its actually northbeam thats lower than prescient, which matches the platform\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-17 13:48** *Jourdan*: Yeah NB would be lower than prescient because NB wasn’t implemented last year\n\n*Reactions: :white_check_mark: Ingrid*
- **2025-07-17 13:57** *Ingrid*: yay for new toys
- **2025-06-13 08:50** *Chris Jacob*: <!channel> I've given access to Shopify and Northbeam ping me here as additional accesses are noted
- **2025-06-13 09:09** *Chris Jacob*: @Jourdan can you also confirm current address so I can ship you product suite
- **2025-06-13 12:19** *Jourdan*: Sweet! Thank you and 3387 Central Ave. Spring valley, CA 91977
- **2025-06-13 13:09** *Ingrid*: Hey @Chris Jacob let's add Jourdan's HD email to all the ad accounts, please: Meta, Google, Pinterest, Twitter/x, TT/TT Shop
- **2025-06-13 13:11** *Ingrid*: Also, not ads related he will need access to: Klaviyo, Attentive, Postscript, Decile, Bark AI (i can email if you don't do this)
- **2025-06-13 13:43** *Ingrid*: also, Motion please
- **2025-06-13 13:47** *Ingrid*: also GA4
- **2025-06-13 14:43** *Chris Jacob*: @Ingrid what google ad account # do you access i'm confused by why i dont see you in either the ad account or ad manager account but i have historically had issues granting acces in it
- **2025-06-13 14:45** *Chris Jacob*: @Jourdan what email do you prefer meta ad access through
- **2025-06-13 14:46** *Jourdan*: lets go with the work email @Chris Jacob

- **2025-06-13 14:50** *Chris Jacob* 💬 1 reply: do you only access in analytics and not [ads.google.com](http://ads.google.com)?
- **2025-06-13 14:59** *Chris Jacob*: @Jourdan let me know once you get in TT ads I have to assign additional permissions after you'r ein
- **2025-06-13 15:33** *Chris Jacob*: @Jourdan when you get the products please take some picture in and out of boxes we always like to check how warehouse did packing stuff
- **2025-06-13 15:46** *Chris Jacob*: i think i gave all access except i dont access twitter think maybe katie has?
- **2025-06-13 15:46** *Chris Jacob*: @Jourdan let me know as you encounter any roadblocks with specific permissioning
- **2025-06-16 09:58** *Chris Jacob*: <!channel>  
• We are due our periodic discussion with Northbeam but I cancelled until @Jourdan gets up to speed so let me know when you want that scheduled  
• As Applovin is new channel last week, it goes into any "total spend" setups in NB but you may need to make sure it's manually added on other dashboards if they have broken down info
- **2025-06-16 10:07** *Jourdan*: @Chris Jacob can you resend Klaviyo and Attentive invites? They have a short expiration window.  
  
I’m in TT so can assign additional permissions
- **2025-06-16 10:14** *Chris Jacob*: @Jourdan done
- **2025-06-16 10:17** *Jourdan*: Thank you sir :saluting_face:
- **2025-06-16 10:31** *Chris Jacob*: @Jourdan regarding NB, the affiliate platforms AWIN and ShopMy are non automated. My team member Josan manually inputs overnight (she's in PHP) but sometimes a lag on weekends FYI. This would result in those channels on particular days (and then total spend) being below reality.  All the paid channels are automated
- **2025-06-16 10:33** *Jourdan*: Okay thank you for the clarity on that. Something like [https://www.sarasanalytics.com/saras-daton/sources](https://www.sarasanalytics.com/saras-daton/sources) could help automate that but if those platforms are small then they may not have connectors either\n\n**sarasanalytics.com**\n🔗 **[200+ Data Connectors for Ecommerce and D2C Brands | Saras Analytics](https://www.sarasanalytics.com/saras-daton/sources)**\n> Discover 200+ plug-and-play connectors for Shopify, Amazon, Meta, TikTok, and more.

- **2025-06-16 10:34** *Chris Jacob*: Don't see them. Both are terrible at backend stuff.  AWIN fully replaced ShareaSale that they acquired at some point its a mess
- **2025-06-16 10:34** *Chris Jacob*: Josan is helpful in general if and when you find any tasks that are manual data work
- **2025-06-16 15:18** *Jourdan*: i still need access to motion, is that something you can help with? @Chris Jacob
- **2025-06-16 15:46** *Chris Jacob*: @Ingrid I still never got access to admin or anything
- **2025-06-16 15:57** *Ingrid*: lemme try
- **2025-06-16 15:58** *Ingrid*: i think i just sent you an invite - we are on together in 2 min so we can donfirm
- **2025-06-16 16:01** *Jourdan*: invite accepted :saluting_face:
- **2025-06-16 16:09** *Chris Jacob*: @Jourdan they don't let me touch creative cuz all the ads would just be a still image that says "hey if you want to buy anything let us know"
- **2025-06-16 16:18** *Ingrid*: lmao he's right

- **2025-07-16 09:50** *Chris Jacob*: You are getting invites to Buxton, this is through elevar based on our Ga4 data they output Personas, limited in scope but Buxton is the go to in the health and wellness industry for demographic data if hepful
