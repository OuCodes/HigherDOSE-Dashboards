**Jourdan** (2025-07-10 17:39:29):
Okay yes i can work on the H1 breakdown

**Jourdan** (2025-07-10 17:43:05):
and we’re on day 2 so not a lot of data.

However Red Light Hat is strongest campaign based on in platform data with 2.83 ROAS and $780 AOV
Red Light Mask has one purchase a .50 ROAS
PEMF Mat has one conversion at .9 ROAS
Sauna Blanket has one conversion  at .08 ROAS but low AOV ($70) so i think it tracked a conversion from a different product

**Jourdan** (2025-07-10 17:43:18):
$750/day budget across each of those campaigns

**Jourdan** (2025-07-10 17:45:11):
I’d give til end of day 3 to assess

**Ingrid** (2025-07-10 17:54:07):
ok cool - i LOVE having this level of product data

**Ingrid** (2025-07-10 17:55:01):
let's try to move the needle on our YoY growth, down 6% is bad

**Ingrid** (2025-07-10 17:55:33):
can you dig in and see where the bleeding is?

**Jourdan** (2025-07-10 18:09:32):
Surface level, I’m sure you see this too but CVR is down 52%, AOV down 13%, and Return customer down 10%  although sessions are up 132%. Also seeing discounts higher ($52.7k) this month than last year ($38.7k).  [Discounts](https://admin.shopify.com/store/higherdose/analytics/reports/total*sales*by*product?ql=FROM+sales%0A++SHOW+net*items*sold%2C+gross*sales%2C+discounts%2C+returns%2C+net*sales%2C+taxes%2C%0A++++total*sales%0A++WHERE+product*title+IS+NOT+NULL%0A++GROUP+BY+product*title%2C+product*vendor%2C+product*type+WITH+TOTALS%2C%0A++++PERCENT*CHANGE%0A++SINCE+startOfMonth%280m%29+UNTIL+today%0A++COMPARE+TO+previous*year%0A++ORDER+BY+total*sales+DESC%0A++LIMIT+1000%0AVISUALIZE+total*sales+TYPE+horizontal_bar) doesn’t make sense since we didn’t have 4th of July sale.

Sessions alone could explain CVR since we’re sending more traffic

Sauna Blanket down 32% in Sales Rev but the Kit is up 26% so discrepancy isn’t that large.
PEMF Pro Mat down 58%

Silver lining, Body Sculptor has 32k in rev which makes up for some of the downtrends from existing products.

**Jourdan** (2025-07-10 18:16:25):
How do we correct, push harder on Red Light Hat. Seems to be the most efficient product w/ paid media. This could improve Meta performance and drive more rev. However we need to improve Sauna Blanket and PEMF Mat paid media performance. Could be a creative solution or produce new landing page assets for those products.

**Ingrid** (2025-07-10 18:34:11):
Can you please align with Laura for that creative brief due tomorrow

**Ingrid** (2025-07-10 18:34:28):
Let’s include everything we need to push these softer comp products 

**Ingrid** (2025-07-10 18:34:42):
She said you never go back to her?

**Jourdan** (2025-07-10 18:37:55):
Looks like she tagged me in the brief last night (Im CST right now) but I just got back to her with a reply and added in Red Light Hat to her product mix

**Jourdan** (2025-07-10 18:38:13):
From what Jake shared we’ve got more Blanket and PEMF creative than Red Light

**Jourdan** (2025-07-10 18:38:25):
however with sales being down we still need resources here to improve efficiency

**Jourdan** (2025-07-10 18:39:43):
Do we want to focus on the Red Light Neck Enhancer?

**Jourdan** (2025-07-10 19:02:32):
What products should we focus on for CTV? I know Core 4 for sure but are there any others we should include?

**Jourdan** (2025-07-10 19:03:25):
Laura brought up Full Spectrum Sauna and mentioned Lauren has interest mixing topicals into our efforts  :eyes:

**Ingrid** (2025-07-10 20:12:12):
I’d start with lifestyle and core 4 to start, it’s a good intro to the brand 

**Ingrid** (2025-07-10 20:12:31):
Then we can add full size and topicals once we prove out the channel on the basics 

**Jourdan** (2025-07-10 20:13:35):
Okay sounds good

**Jourdan** (2025-07-10 20:13:36):
thank you

**Jourdan** (2025-07-10 20:17:37):
Okay any interest in Endorphin oil + sweat band, trans mag spray, and press?

These are lower AOV so i assume keeping it to Red Light, PEMF, and SB to get us back on track would be ideal?

**Ingrid** (2025-07-11 17:06:35):
Appreciate you being on top of sharma on those campaigns!

**Jourdan** (2025-07-11 17:10:39):
Of course! I want to get this thing turned around asap. Meta can be a lot better which will lift the entire ecosystem and make rev targets at efficiency a bit easier. Seeing these segmented by product is so valuable! Thank you for being behind that push as well

**Ingrid** (2025-07-11 17:23:33):
Yes getting meta right will do soooo much 

**Ingrid** (2025-07-11 17:23:43):
Go team
